            "text": "General Loop FAQs\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are lots of new users coming to Loop trying to find out information about Omnipod potentially being supported on Loop. You probably have a lot of questions.\n\n\nWhat is Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nClick on the image below to watch an short \nIntroduction to Loop video\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do I need to Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop has both hardware and software requirements.  In general, to use Loop you need to have seven components.\n\n\n\n\nCompatible insulin pump: \nMedtronic\n or \nOmnipod\n\n\nCompatible CGM\n\n\nRileyLink\n\n\nCompatible iPhone/iPod Touch\n\n\nApple computer running High Sierra/Mojave macOS 10.13.6/10.14 or later\n\n\nXcode (a free Apple application)\n\n\nApple Developer Membership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I download Loop from the App store?\n\u2301\n\n\nNo. Loop is not available for download. You must build your own Loop app.\n\n\nBut don't worry, building your Loop app is actually quite easy and that's what these docs are all about. The harder part will be having the patience to read all the documents before you start.  New Loop users are so excited to get started that they skip reading all the great info that these docs contain.  So, as you begin the build...please include time to read the documents that follow what happens AFTER you successfully build your Loop app.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, these docs have a nice search feature in the dark blue top menu bar that may help you find your answers pretty quickly too.\n\n\nCan I use an android phone for Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nNo, this is purely iPhone or iPod touch.\n\n\nDo I have to be \"tech-smart\" to build Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nNo. You do not need any experience in code or computers to build Loop. If you have already owned an Apple computer and iPhone, you already have the required level of experience. Beyond that, simply read the directions slowly and diligently...all the information you will need are in these documents.\n\n\nIs there a cheat sheet for school nurse to use?\n\u2301\n\n\nSure, you can give this one a try. \nSchool nurse's cheat sheet download\n\n\nHow long does it take to build Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nThe answer is varied, but a few hours from start to finish, depending on where you are starting.\n\n\nIf you'd rather break it up into several days of shorter efforts, the advent calendar way of building Loop can be done like this:\n\n\nDay 1 (15 minutes): Order a RileyLink from \nGetRileyLink.org\n\nDay 2 (30 minutes or less): Update macOS and install Homebrew on your computer.\n\nDay 3 (20 minutes): Get an Apple Developer account (wait for enrollment confirmation email)\n\nDay 4 (1-2 hours): Download and setup Xcode (basically this step is one that you can walk away from since the download just chugs along while you go do other things) \n\nDay 5 (50 minutes): Build Loop app using Xcode\n\n\nDoes Loop cost money?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, there are some costs, beyond the obvious costs of owning a pump and CGM.\n\n\nThe \nRileyLink kit\n costs $150. This is a one-time cost and many people still have their original RileyLinks from nearly 3 years ago running just fine. There is a \nlipo battery\n that may need to periodically be swapped out after a couple years of use, and that is approximately $15. I highly recommend purchasing two RileyLinks when financially feasible, to have one as a backup in case of accidental damage.\n\n\nThe Apple Developer License can be done for free, however, you will have to rebuild your Loop app every 7 days. That could get very tedious. The $99 annual Apple developer program enrollment is an excellent investment.\n\n\nThere are no other costs, ongoing or initial, to Loop use.\n\n\nDo I need to own my own Apple computer?\n\u2301\n\n\nYou don't have to own your own Apple computer, but you do need to at least borrow one. It would be really good to have longer term ability to borrow that computer again for \nupdating Loop\n later, when needed.\n\n\nIf you are borrowing an Apple computer, you should ask the person to (1) update to at least High Sierra or Mojave and (2) \ndownload Xcode for free\n before you get together to build your Loop app.  The updates and download of Xcode can take a couple hours depending on the person's internet speed...so best to do those steps well ahead of time to save trouble.\n\n\nHow often do I need to get on the computer for Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nThe short answer is (1) when you first build and (2) once per year minimum after that. (If you decide to use a free Apple Developer Account, you will need to get on the computer every 7 days.)\n\n\nThe longer answer is that Loop code is updated periodically to include new features and bug fixes.  When those updates are released, you'll need access to an Apple computer again to update your Loop app.  Loop updates are not available through the iPhone's app store...instead you do the app upate yourself with \nupdate instructions here\n. In general, probably a few times a year there are updates to Loop released that you'd want to take the time to install.\n\n\nCan I use a VirtualMachine to build?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, you can. These documents will not provide instructions on how to do that however. You'll need to figure that part out on your own.\n\n\nWill I need to build a new Loop if I switch between Medtronic and Omnipod regularly?\n\u2301\n\n\nNo. Loop will have the option to move between different pump types from within the same Loop app.\n\n\nCan I use someone else's Apple Developer account?\n\u2301\n\n\nTechnically, yes...however there are major drawbacks. The person's developer account can only be \"linked\" to a limited number of build computers. So one person \"loaning out\" their developer license to a lot of people will quickly exceed the number of allowed computers. In those cases, that person will be told they need to revoke the certificates on some computers (essentially dropping old ones to make room for new ones). When they do that, they may have forgotten about your Loop app on your computer. When they revoke your computer's certificate (and they can do that without you knowing through their developer portal), your Loop app will immediately stop working and not even open.\n\n\nYou Loop app will also die immediately if their developer account is not renewed or expires. Your Loop updates will also not be able to be built unless that person maintains the developer license agreement updates.\n\n\nMoral of the story, out of all the ways to save money...borrowing someone's developer account is not a good place to save money.\n\n\nHow can I find a compatible pump? supplies?\n\u2301\n\n\nThere is a \nwhole page about MDT pumps\n; how to find them, how to find supplies, and assessing whether your Medtronic pump is compatible. Go check out that page for more info.\n\n\nWith the addition of omnipod support, you can also now use omnipod suppliers however you'd normally source them.\n\n\nCan I pay someone else to do this?\n\u2301\n\n\nNOOOO...you really need to figure this out yourself. This is an automated insulin delivery system and you really need to know how to build and operate this yourself.\n\n\nWhat if I lose my RileyLink?\n\u2301\n\n\nFor Medtronic users, you simply go back to old school pump use until you get a new RileyLink. You can either let your temp basal finish by itself (30 minutes or less) or cancel the temp basal on the pump's menu. For bolusing, you'd go back to using the pump's blus commands. When you get a RileyLink (either finding your old one or getting your backup RileyLink out) and Loop running again, you'll want to do one thing. Enter in any carbs to Loop that you may have eaten in the recent past that could still be affecting blood glucose. While Loop will read whatever insulin deliveries had happened while the RileyLink was missing, it will not read any carbs you entered into the pump...so make sure to add those to Loop and backdate them to the time they were eaten. That will help make the transition smoother to Looping again.\n\n\nFor pod users, your pod will finish any currently running temporary basal rate and then revert back to your scheduled basal rate. Without a RileyLink, you will not be able to affect any pod use; no basal changes, suspends, or boluses. If you have a backup RileyLink, you can simply connect to the new RileyLink on the same Loop app and it will work with the existing pod session. If you don't have a backup RileyLink, you'll have to remove the pod and start a new pod paired with your PDM until you get a new RileyLink.\n\n\nWhat if I lose or get a new iPhone?\n\u2301\n\n\nWhen you get a new iPhone, Loop will need to be built onto that new iPhone in the same way that you built on your old iPhone. Loop will not restore from any iCloud or iTunes backups, so make sure you plan on finding an Apple computer to rebuild on before you plan on Looping with the new iPhone.\n\n\nWhat about other pumps? When will they Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nHey now...let's be grateful for what we have first. The ability to use Loop is the result of tremendous amounts of effort, time, and sacrifice by volunteers. Cracking the pumps for Loop use is a large undertaking. If and when another set of people spend a large amount of time figuring out other pumps, then they could conceivably be added to Loop.  But, you don't need to let us know that you'd love to see more pumps compatible with Loop.  So would we. There is just an awful lot of work that needs to happen and it is not easy nor quick.\n\n\nCan I have more than one Loop app on a phone?\n\u2301\n\n\nWhile technically possible, you can have multiple Loop apps built onto the same iPhone.  However, having multiple Loop apps on a single phone may lead to unexpected conflicts that can negatively affect your Loop's ability to stay green (keep looping).  For smooth looping, just keep one Loop app on any phone for looping use.\n\n\nWill I be able to Loop on a plane? or in the mountains?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes. Loop does not require internet or cell coverage to work. So long as the Looper has Bluetooth turned on on the iPhone (or iPod touch), then the Dexcom and RileyLink will still be able to do their work with Loop and your pump/pod.",

You can either let your temp basal finish by itself (30 minutes or less) or cancel the temp basal on the pump's menu. For bolusing, you'd go back to using the pump's blus commands. When you get a RileyLink (either finding your old one or getting your backup RileyLink out) and Loop running again, you'll want to do one thing. Enter in any carbs to Loop that you may have eaten in the recent past that could still be affecting blood glucose. While Loop will read whatever insulin deliveries had happened while the RileyLink was missing, it will not read any carbs you entered into the pump...so make sure to add those to Loop and backdate them to the time they were eaten. That will help make the transition smoother to Looping again.  For pod users, your pod will finish any currently running temporary basal rate and then revert back to your scheduled basal rate. Without a RileyLink, you will not be able to affect any pod use; no basal changes, suspends, or boluses. If you have a backup RileyLink, you can simply connect to the new RileyLink on the same Loop app and it will work with the existing pod session. If you don't have a backup RileyLink, you'll have to remove the pod and start a new pod paired with your PDM until you get a new RileyLink.",

Omnipod has been in the process of being \"hacked\" for several years now and this has been a tremendous amount of work. The work has been fruitful...but it is not ready for public release yet. When it is ready, we promise to update these documents with instructions and information about Omnipod Loop.\n\n\nWhich pods will work with Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Loop system described in these documents (aka DIY Loop) will work with Eros pods...these are the current pods on the market in wide release. The newer DASH pods will not be compatible with DIY Loop. Tidepool has begun a process to bring \nDIY Loop through FDA approval\n and Insulet has been announced as the \nfirst pump partner for that project\n. Tidepool Loop will be using DASH pods, no RileyLink required.

They will pair with only one device at a time for safety reasons...so a pod is either paired with a PDM or your Loop app on your iPhone. In other words, your PDM can stay in the diabetes closet while you are Looping. You cannot use the PDM for a pod that has been activated with Loop. That doesn't mean you should get rid of your PDM. Instead, keep it for backup situations if you lose your phone. See below for what to do if you lose your phone or RileyLink. \n\n\nCan I cancel a temp basal Loop sets? How about a bolus?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, you will be able to cancel a temp basal or a bolus in progress. There is a \"suspend delivery\" command that is easy to access by tapping on the \npod age icon in your Heads Up Display, upper right area\n. Suspending insulin delivery will cancel any running temp basal or bolus in progress. The suspend command will run indefinitely. A banner notification will be displayed on the Loop main screen while insulin delivery is suspended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin will remain suspended until the user either clicks on the \"Tap to Resume\" command from Loop's main screen or the \"resume delivery\" command accessed by tapping the pod age icon. Once insulin delivery is resumed, you will be resumed at your scheduled basal rate. If a bolus was interrupted, the bolus will not resume. If you don't turn on open loop mode, within 5 minutes of resuming insulin delivery, your Loop should resume automatic temp basal adjustments.\n\n\nWhat if I lose my phone or RileyLink?\n\u2301\n\n\nFor pod users, your pod will finish any currently running temporary basal rate and then revert back to your scheduled basal rate. Without a phone or RileyLink however, you will not be able to affect any pod use; no basal change, suspend, cancel, or bolus. To do anything other than let basals continue, you will need to take action depending on the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLost RileyLink only: You can find replace your missing RileyLink with one from your backup supplies. No problem to switch out to a different Rileylink mid-pod session.

You'll need a hug and follow the same directions as if you lost the phone as shown in the bullet above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there an increase in pod failures on Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nIn the early stages of development, there were. Thankfully to the hard work of Pete Schwamb and others, pod failure rate is now no longer increased compared to typical pod use with a PDM.\n\n\nWhat do you do to stop a screaming pod?\n\u2301\n\n\nScreaming pods can be silenced by carrying a paperclip. Simply put the paperclip in the small hole that is on the bottom (the side opposite where the cannula is) of the pod as shown. Push the paperclip in until you hear a little click, that click is breaking the circuit that let's the audible scream go.",

It is only an upgrade if you want to pod Loop. The new antenna will actually decrease your range if you try to use it with a Medtronic Loop.  See the next FAQ for more detailed description and chart.\n\n\nWhat will happen if you use a 916MHz antenna RL with an Omnipod? Or vice versa?\n\u2301\n\n\nThe answer will first depend on exactly how old that RL is and what firmware it has installed.\n\n\nBefore August 2018, RLs had a firmware that works for only Medtronic pump communication. So, if you have the older firmware on a RL, your pod will never pair in Loop using that RL. The GetRileyLink site does offer a \nRL firmware update service\n, if you want to update to the newer pod-usable firmware.\n\n\nRLs produced after August 2018, include newer firmware that is needed for Omnipod pump communications as well. The newer firmware will say \nsubg_rfspy 2.2/ble_rfspy 2.0\n in the RL menu, like below when paired in Loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming your has the newer RL firmware, you can \ntechnically\n use that RL with either pump on Loop. But, you will have significant frustrations with the short distances required between the pump/pod and RL when using the \"wrong\" antenna. Even keeping RL in the pocket on opposite of where pod is on your body can cause issues with the 916MHz antenna. With mismatched antenna/pump, the RL needs to be very close and in clear line-of-sight to pump/pod, that it makes everyday living a bit hard. If you use the appropriate-antenna-for-your-pump RL, the distances the pump/pod and RL can tolerate from each other is much more \"real world\" friendly and stable.\n\n\nIn summary, definitely use the appropriate RL with the antenna that matches your pump so that you are less frustrated. In a pinch, your old RL might work as a backup, but you won't love it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you swap out the old antenna on a RL?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, the antenna swap is not a hard swap if you just have basic soldering skills. The old antenna can be removed easily by reheating the solder. New 433MHz antennas and a cap can be found on \nGetRileyLink site\n. Tips: use flux and clean the antenna stub before soldering. Poorly DIY-soldered antennas can lead to decreased range and frequent communication drops between Loop and the pods.\n\n\nHow long will my RL last?\n\u2301\n\n\nI am still using the original RL from 2.5 years ago, so would seem like a long time.\n\n\nHow long will my RL battery last?\n\u2301\n\n\nEventually, lipo batteries will lose charging capacity and you would want to replace if you notice the battery not lasting the full day. We've been using our current battery for nearly 2 years without issue.\n\n\nHow can I tell how much charge my RL has?\n\u2301\n\n\nYou can't. There is no charge level indicator. Just charge it nightly, and you won't have a problem. Full battery charge should last about 30-36 hours depending on battery health. Charging takes less than 2 hours.\n\n\nHow should I carry the RL? Does it make a difference?\n\u2301\n\n\nIn general, you want to get in the habit of carrying RL with you, yes. A pocket, carabiner, lanyard, spi-belt...the options are endless. What you don't want to do is put the RL in a blocking bag that has Rf-ID blocking (some travel fanny packs have that). The distance that your RL can be away from your pump will depend heavily on the environment you are in.\n\n\nIs RL waterproof?\n\u2301\n\n\nNope. Nor is it sweat-proof. Be careful.\n\n\nWhat is the most common issue for RL?\n\u2301\n\n\nPeople not \npushing the lipo battery\n in all the way when they first assemble their RL. It takes quite a bit of push to get the plug in well enough. If not secured well, Loop will have more frequent problems.\n\n\nCan I use more than one RL at a time? Will it improve anything?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, you can have two turned on, but it won't help anything really. Loop only uses one RL at a time. IF you have several RLs turned on in Loop settings, your Loop will only look for another RL after Loop fails for over 15 minutes on the original RL. In my experience, it is rare that Loop would fail for more than 15 minutes and a second RL would help in the same environment. If one RL gets damaged though and you need to swap out to a second RL, there's no issues with that. \n\n\nCan I run Loop without a RL?\n\u2301\n\n\nNope.",

Compatibility has two requirements; (1) pump model and (2) firmware.\n\n\n\n\nLOOP COMPATIBLE MEDTRONIC PUMPS:\n The 515/715 and 522/722 pumps are all compatible.  The 523/723 and 554/754 pumps will require you to check the firmware to see if the pump is Loop compatible.  See the footnotes 3 and 4 for the required firmwares.\n\n\nLOOP \nNOT\n COMPATIBLE PUMPS:\n The 512/712, 551, 751, 530, 670G pumps are \nNOT\n compatible with Loop system. Animas, T-slim, Dana-RS, Roche Combo, Medtronic 600 series and any other name of pump that you wish to insert are also \nNOT\n compatible.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \nInsulin Pump\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nMM 515/715\n\n      \nMM 522/722\n2\n\n      \nMM 523/723\n3\n\n      \nMM 554/754\n4\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nCGM\n\n      \nDexcom G4\n1\n \n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nDexcom G5\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \nDexcom G6\n\n    \n\u2705\n\n    \n\u2705\n\n    \n\u2705\n\n    \n\u2705\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nMM CGM\n\n      \n--\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n. Offline access to glucose requires a Receiver with Share and the \nShare2 app\n to be running on the same iPhone as the Loop app is installed. Internet-dependent access via Share servers is also supported.\n\n2\n. x22 model pumps were produced before firmware security patches were implemented, therefore these models are compatible because they will have firmware 2.4A or lower only.  You can double check, but thus far all x22 pumps we have seen have compatible firmware.\n\n3\n. Firmware 2.4A or lower is required for using closed loop and bolus features.\n\n4\n. Worldwide Veo (2.6A or lower) or Canadian/Australian Veo (2.7A or lower) is required for using closed loop and bolus features. A US version of this pump is not available.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to triple check compatibility, you can check for presence/absence of \"PC connect\" in the pump.  If PC Connect is present, then the pump is NOT compatible.  You can find PC connect in the Medtronic's Main Menu, Utilities, Connect Devices.  PC Connect, if present, will be the first option showing in that menu, above the word \"Meters\".  If you do \nNOT\n see PC Connect there...good!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPump Model\n\u2301\n\n\nTo determine your pump model, look at the back side of your pump.  There should be a sticker on the underside of the pump.  On the right hand side of the sticker, it says REF MMT-XXXXXX\n\n\n\n\n    MMT       Pump Manufacturer Model (MiniMed Medtronic)\n    722       Pump Model Number\n    NA        Pump Region (NA=North America, CA=Canada/Australia, WW=Worldwide)\n    S         Pump Color (S=Smoke, L=Clear/Lucite, B=Blue, P=Pink/Purple)\n\n\n\n\nSome pumps may have an \u201cL\u201d or \u201cS\u201d or \"R\" before the pump region, e.g. a model number like MMT-722LNAS.  This does not affect Loop compatibility.\n\n\nPump Differences\n\u2301\n\n\nThe  differences between the pump models are limited.\n\n\n500 vs 700\n:  The difference between the Medtronic 500 series and the 700 series pumps is the size of the insulin reservoirs.  The 500 series pumps use a 180 unit reservoir, and the 700 series pumps use a 300 unit reservoir (or smaller 180 unit reservoir, if you want).\n\n\nx15/x22 vs x23/x54\n:  The difference between the x15 and x22 pumps versus the x23 and x54 series pumps has only a few notable mentions:\n\n\n\n\nThe x23/x54 pumps will allow for smaller insulin deliveries in certain situations, if the smaller scroll rate is selected in the Bolus\nSetup\nScroll Rate menu.  \nLoop will have the insulin delivery automatically rounded by the pump to the units available in the pump model, and any smaller adjustments (to make up for the rounding) will be made through Loop\u2019s use of temp basals.  If you want the smaller increments of basal rates, you can still enter those values in Loop app's settings and Loop will use those values for the purposes of insulin delivery calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPump Model\n\n\nBasal increments\n\n\nBolus increments\n\n\nRange\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n515/715\nand\n522/722\n\n\n0.05\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n0.1\n\n\ndeliveries less than 10 units\ngreater than 10 units\n\n\n\n\n\n\n523/723\nand\n554/754\n\n\n0.025\n0.05\n0.1\n\n\n0.025 \n0.05 \n0.1\n\n\nbetween 0.025 to 0.975 units\nbetween 1 to 9.95 units\ngreater than 10 units\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, because of the way Loop fetches information from the pump, the x23/x54 series of pumps are slightly better at conserving battery life through the use of the MySentry packets to collect information from the pump.  x22 pumps do not use MySentry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe x23/x54 series pumps are also faster at delivering boluses greater than 10 units.  On an x23 pump, a 13-unit bolus takes 5:00 minutes to complete.  On an x22 pump, a 13-unit bolus takes 8:40 minutes to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPump Firmware\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nIf you are looking to use a 523/723 or 554/754 pump, you will need to check the firmware version for compatibility.\n\n\n\n\nA pump\u2019s firmware is the internal software that runs your pump.  Older Medtronic firmware allows Loop to act as a \u201cremote control\u201d to set temp basals and report back pump data.  Newer firmware disabled that \u201cremote control\u201d access and therefore cannot be used with these DIY closed loop systems.  There is currently no ability to downgrade a pump\u2019s firmware or replace it with older firmware.  Before you buy a used pump, make sure you are getting one with compatible firmware.\n\n\nTo find your pump\u2019s firmware you will need to power it on.  If the pump has not been powered on for some time (i.e., has been in storage without a battery for awhile), it will run through a start-up count and the firmware version will appear on the bottom right of the pump\u2019s screen.  Don\u2019t turn away, as the version number will only be displayed for a little while before the screen moves onto other information displays.  \n\n\nIf the pump has been active recently or has a reservoir installed, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress the \n button on your pump.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down with the \n button to the bottom of the status display.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the bottom line of the display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding a Medtronic pump\n\u2301\n\n\nFinding a compatible Medtronic pump is probably the most difficult part for most new Loopers.  Our suggestion:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk to friends in the diabetic community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk your endocrinologist.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk at a local JDRF chapter meeting if someone has an old backup pump they'd be willing to donate to you.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin diabetic supply groups in Facebook; both for-trade and for-sale groups.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Craigslist often and be willing to expand your search area to include larger cities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the \nHelpAround, NextDoor, OfferUp, and/or LetGo\n apps for pumps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch \nMedwow\n for used Medtronic pumps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedwow has been fairly frustrating for most people; poor response rate, high prices.  The most success appears to come from either one-on-one discussions with fellow diabetics/doctors or using apps (Craigslist, NextDoor, LetGo, HelpAround).  If you are using Craigslist, you may wish to use an app on your iPhone to make the searching easier.  There are apps to search multiple cities at once for your keywords and set up alerts.\n\n\n\n\nSafe Purchasing\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you choose to purchase from a remote or unknown seller, here are some tips for safe purchasing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse PayPal and purchase using the \"Goods and Services\" payment option. This costs nothing for the buyer, but the seller will lose 2.95% of the sale to PayPal fees. PayPal offers some protection for both buyer and seller in the event of fraud.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk for photos of the pump. Check to make sure the serial number of the pump on the backside matches the serial number of the pump showing in the display menu. Ask for a short video of the pump, or at least a photo of the pump turned on, so that you can see the pump's firmware and model number. Cracks and some wear on these pumps is expected. These pumps are not usually free of marks. Many people are successfully looping on pumps that have cracks and rub marks, but you may want to ask if you are concerned about any you see in photos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeware if the bottom of the reservoir/motor sleeve has the drive support cap pushed out, as shown \nhere\n. Those pumps will generally not work (or only work intermittently), however some people have successfully repaired those pumps as shown in that link. Just be aware that it should be checked in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepairs to cracks or missing bits of plastic on battery cap area and reservoir caps are possible and not very difficult in most situations. You can read more about how to repair those \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk for shipping that includes a tracking number. USPS Priority Mail's smallest box is a great option.  It's only $7.20 domestically in US and includes tracking. Ask the seller to add a small bit of packing protection such as bubble wrap around the pump to keep it safe during shipping. Make sure you get a tracking number within a reasonable period of time after you have paid.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed flags that may indicate a scam:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsking for payment through \"friends and family\" on PayPal, especially if you don't know the person or have any solid references for them. Paying in that way offers you no buyer protection. It's just like giving the seller cash, so you had better trust the seller.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffering an \"almost new\" pump is a big red flag. These pumps should be at least 5 years old by now. Do you really think a 5 year old pump should be unused and sitting in shrink wrap at this point? Seems highly suspicious. There are some out there, but they are very infrequent.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot able to provide new pictures of the pump when requested. Sure they posted some pictures with the ad, but what if they just downloaded them from other people's ads? The seller should be able to furnish a couple \"new\" photos are your request. A good one to ask for is the battery and reservoir tops so you can see the condition of those.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPump Supplies\n\u2301\n\n\nMedtronic will not typically sell pump supplies directly to customers who have not previously purchased a registered Medtronic pump. Ask your insurance about purchasing pump supplies through a durable medical equipment (DME) provider. Typically, the DME provider will coordinate with your insurance and doctor's office to get the necessary insurance approval and prescriptions for the supplies. If you are brand new to Medtronic infusion sites, you may want to ask for help from friends to try a variety of infusion sets before purchasing a full 90-day supply of any type in particular.",

Animas, T-slim, Dana-RS, Roche Combo, Medtronic 600 series and any other name of pump that you wish to insert are also  NOT  compatible.   \n   \n     \n       \n       Insulin Pump \n     \n     \n       MM 515/715 \n       MM 522/722 2 \n       MM 523/723 3 \n       MM 554/754 4 \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       CGM \n       Dexcom G4 1   \n       \u2705 \n       \u2705 \n       \u2705 \n       \u2705 \n     \n     \n       Dexcom G5 \n       \u2705 \n       \u2705 \n       \u2705 \n       \u2705 \n     \n     \n     Dexcom G6 \n     \u2705 \n     \u2705 \n     \u2705 \n     \u2705 \n     \n     \n       MM CGM \n       -- \n       \u2705 \n       \u2705 \n       \u2705 \n     \n     1 . Offline access to glucose requires a Receiver with Share and the  Share2 app  to be running on the same iPhone as the Loop app is installed. Internet-dependent access via Share servers is also supported. 2 . x22 model pumps were produced before firmware security patches were implemented, therefore these models are compatible because they will have firmware 2.4A or lower only.  You can double check, but thus far all x22 pumps we have seen have compatible firmware. 3 . Firmware 2.4A or lower is required for using closed loop and bolus features. 4 . Worldwide Veo (2.6A or lower) or Canadian/Australian Veo (2.7A or lower) is required for using closed loop and bolus features. A US version of this pump is not available.   If you want to triple check compatibility, you can check for presence/absence of \"PC connect\" in the pump.  If PC Connect is present, then the pump is NOT compatible.  You can find PC connect in the Medtronic's Main Menu, Utilities, Connect Devices.  PC Connect, if present, will be the first option showing in that menu, above the word \"Meters\".  If you do  NOT  see PC Connect there...good!",

Loop will have the insulin delivery automatically rounded by the pump to the units available in the pump model, and any smaller adjustments (to make up for the rounding) will be made through Loop\u2019s use of temp basals.

This costs nothing for the buyer, but the seller will lose 2.95% of the sale to PayPal fees. PayPal offers some protection for both buyer and seller in the event of fraud.      Ask for photos of the pump. Check to make sure the serial number of the pump on the backside matches the serial number of the pump showing in the display menu. Ask for a short video of the pump, or at least a photo of the pump turned on, so that you can see the pump's firmware and model number. Cracks and some wear on these pumps is expected. These pumps are not usually free of marks. Many people are successfully looping on pumps that have cracks and rub marks, but you may want to ask if you are concerned about any you see in photos.    Beware if the bottom of the reservoir/motor sleeve has the drive support cap pushed out, as shown  here . Those pumps will generally not work (or only work intermittently), however some people have successfully repaired those pumps as shown in that link. Just be aware that it should be checked in advance.    Repairs to cracks or missing bits of plastic on battery cap area and reservoir caps are possible and not very difficult in most situations. You can read more about how to repair those  here .    Ask for shipping that includes a tracking number. USPS Priority Mail's smallest box is a great option.  It's only $7.20 domestically in US and includes tracking. Ask the seller to add a small bit of packing protection such as bubble wrap around the pump to keep it safe during shipping. Make sure you get a tracking number within a reasonable period of time after you have paid.      Red flags that may indicate a scam:    Asking for payment through \"friends and family\" on PayPal, especially if you don't know the person or have any solid references for them. Paying in that way offers you no buyer protection. It's just like giving the seller cash, so you had better trust the seller.      Offering an \"almost new\" pump is a big red flag. These pumps should be at least 5 years old by now. Do you really think a 5 year old pump should be unused and sitting in shrink wrap at this point? Seems highly suspicious. There are some out there, but they are very infrequent.      Not able to provide new pictures of the pump when requested. Sure they posted some pictures with the ad, but what if they just downloaded them from other people's ads? The seller should be able to furnish a couple \"new\" photos are your request. A good one to ask for is the battery and reservoir tops so you can see the condition of those.",

What does that mean to you? It means RL is the communication highway between your insulin pump, CGM, and iPhone.\n\n\nLoop will not work without the RileyLink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuying or Building RL\n\u2301\n\n\nThe RL is available as a set of PCB files and software, with instructions on how to build your own RL hardware module. All this can be found here: \nRileyLink Github\n\nIf you aren\u2019t up to the task of building your own RL (and most of us aren\u2019t), community members coordinate periodic production runs of RLs. You can place an order here: \nRileyLink order site\n\n\nAssembling RL\n\u2301\n\n\nYour RL will come with the battery disconnected and the parts not already inside the case. It will be up to you to put the RL in the case and attach the battery.\n\n\nMake sure the lipo battery is well-plugged into the connection. Line up the little ridge appropriately, and push fairly firmly to get the connection tight.  Poor battery cable connection can make the Loop communications fail.  See photos below, for example.\n\n\n\n\nCommon new user errors\n\n\nThe most common two errors for new RL owners are (1) not fully pushing in the lipo battery cable connection and (2) failing to charge the RL. Compare your lipo battery cable with the photos; it takes a bit of oomph to push that plug fully in like the photos show below. Remember to charge your RL each night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRL with loose battery cable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRL with properly secured battery cable.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the board and the battery fit into the slim case fairly tightly as well.  Click on the image below to watch a helpful \nassembly video\n.\n\n\n\n\nRadio communications\n\u2301\n\n\nThe RL communicates with the pump through radio frequency communications.  Numerous factors can influence how well those communications can function...interferences from other devices, temperature, physical blocking, etc.\n\n\nWhen your RL and pump first pair together, Loop performs a series of tests that you won't see...they are tuning tests. Basically, RL sends little test messages to the pump and waits for a response. The RL tries this same \"ping\" to the pump a range of various radio frequencies. The range of radio frequencies it tries is based on the pump you've told RL to expect (Omnipod, Medtronic NA/CA, or Medtronic WW).  RL will then record the radio frequencies that provided the strongest response and use that frequency for future pump communications.\n\n\nUsually this best frequency is pretty constant for any given pump+RL, but during temperature changes it may be that the best frequency is not the one currently set. In the event that RL has problems communicating with the pump, Loop has code built-in that will automatically tell the RL \"Hey, try that tuning pump thing again...maybe there's a better frequency we need to try.\" This retuning is started automatically if pump communications fail for 14 minutes (in other words, two looping cycles).\n\n\nBluetooth communications\n\u2301\n\n\nRL communicates with your iPhone and Loop app through Bluetooth (BT).  If your iPhone has BT issues, your Loop will have failures.  There have been reports of BT audio devices (such as BT pairings in your car or home audio BT speakers) interfering with the Loop.  If you are finding Loop failures frequently happening at a particular location, you may try to troubleshoot if there are BT problems in the area.\n\n\nYour BT signal strength can be seen in the Loop settings, under the RL menu, on the \nSignal Strength\n line. As you move closer and further away from your phone, you can watch that number dynamically change. This line is \nnot\n displaying the signal strength of your pump communications discussed above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLights\n\u2301\n\n\nRL has several lights that you may notice from time to time. There is no 'power' light. If you suspect that your RL is not being powered, try turning it off and on using the small sliding switch. You should see lights in the middle of the board flash when you do this.  If they flash, that means the board has power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed light: Charging light. The red light will remain on while RL is charging, and it will turn off when charging is complete. You may notice the red light turn on periodically even after charging is complete...it's just \"topping off\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen light: Bluetooth connection light. The green light will remain on while you have BT connection with your iPhone.  If that green light fails to stay on, you should troubleshoot your BT connections. Try restarting BT on your iPhone and/or turning the RL off/on by its power switch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue light: Pump communications.  If you have an older firmware on your RL, some of the blue lights will flash periodically as it is communicating with the pump. It's just letting you know that it is busy talking and collecting info. You will also see increased blue flashes if you have \"Enabled Diagnositic LEDs\" for MDT users that have the RLs with updated firmware (shipping since late August 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA solid blue light that consistenly remains lit on the board could mean one of two things:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA temporary issue that can be resolved by rebooting the RL physically (turning the switch off/on), or\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn electrical short or damage to the board.  Sweat and moisture are most likely culprits, so try to keep case free from those environments. Don't keep RL in sports bras or waist band next to skin, for example, while exercising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your blue light remains on despite trying a restart, it is time to pull out your backup RL.\n\n\nCharging\n\u2301\n\n\nThe battery that comes with RL is not likely charged completely when it is shipped, so feel free to charge it up.  You'll need a \nmini-USB cable\n and \n0.5A USB charging power supply\n like your iPhone power supply.  RL takes about 2 hours to fully charge (the red light will turn off when fully charged, read note above about red light patterns) and should easily last at least a full day of constant Loop use.  Typically, it can go into the 30-hour range without problem.  Most people charge their RL each night when they are sleeping.  You don't have to worry about leaving the RL plugged in \"too long\" for charging.  It will automatically stop charging the battery when it is fully charged.\n\n\nSince the best practice is to charge your RL overnight while you sleep, and the battery lasts safely over 24 hours, there is no battery level indicator for the RL.  The RL's charge level is not viewable on Nightscout, nor within the Loop app.  If you forget to charge your RL overnight, you can recharge it with a portable USB battery in a pinch.  A \nshort mini-USB cable\n could be a good addition to a small gear bag.\n\n\nRange\n\u2301\n\n\nThe range that your RL will function is \nheavily\n dependent on the environment that you are in. Most people wear the RL in a pocket or carry a belt holster during the day. The radio frequency communications will have a shorter range than the BT communications, therefore RL will do better closer to the pump rather than the iPhone if you are deciding on options for carrying gear. \n\n\nProblematic environments will be places like technical conferences, sports arenas, and other places where wireless communications are heavy and plenty.\n\n\nLipo Battery\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you ordered your RL kit, you will need to plug in the battery cable.  Please make sure your RL\u2019s battery cable is securely pushed all the way into the socket.  Poor battery cable connection can make the Loop communications fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRL with loose battery cable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRL with properly secured battery cable.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep your RL and lipo battery protected from damage.  Lipo batteries are unsafe when damaged or punctured, so the case is an important part of safe Looping.  If your battery is damaged in some way, please disconnect it immediately, and dispose of it (they should be recycled). You can order new batteries on the \nGetRileyLink website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving Lipo Battery\n\u2301\n\n\nTo remove the lipo battery from the RL, please do so slowly and patiently. Work the battery connection side to side slowly to loosen it from the plug. Some people have reported success using small, curved needle nose pliers such as hemostats. Others have used small flathead screwdrivers as shown in \nthis video\n.\n\n\n\n\nWaiting for RL\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, waiting for RL to arrive is extremely difficult if they are backorder.  PLEASE be patient, since Loop CANNOT work without RL.\n\n\nIf you're really dying to do something while RL ships, consider these things below.\n\n\nFIRST AND FOREMOST: If you switched pumps in order to Loop, get used to the pump and start using it before Loop.  Sometimes switching pumps will lead to a change in your settings (basals, boluses, etc) simply by the way the new cannula delivers insulin. It's a great idea to use your pump and sets before you ever begin Loop so that you can have one less variable when you do start looping. At least you can check if you need to adjust basals or other settings.  The same tips apply for Dexcom.  If you are new to Dexcom, start using it before Loop. Get familiar with things like compression lows, sensor variability, and calibration timing before Loop use.\n\n\nBut, if you're familiar with your pump and Dexcom, here are some ideas:\n\n\n\n\nProgram your pump with your basal patterns\n\n\nEnter the other pump settings required for Loop to work\n\n\nUpdate your iPhone/iPod touch's iOS, if needed\n\n\nUpdate your computer's macOS, if needed\n\n\nUpdate your Apple Watch's watchOS, if needed\n\n\nDownload Xcode from the Apple App Store on your Apple computer (\nthis takes more time than you'd expect, it is a large download\n)\n\n\nSign up for a Developer Account. Confirm your enrollment by checking your email afterwards.\n\n\nInstall Homebrew on your computer\n\n\nDownload Loop source code and get started with Loop building\n\n\nMake customizations, if desired\n\n\nBuild Loop app onto your iPhone/iPod touch\n\n\nSet up a Nightscout site or update your existing site (optional)\n\n\nBookmark the LoopDocs page for future reference\n\n\nJoin \nZulipchat\n and/or \nthe Looped Facebook Group\n\n\n\n\nBUT, then you must wait.  \nYou can't go any further with Loop operations until you get the RL.\n  However, if you do all those things above while you wait...you will be ready to go as soon as the postman knocks on your door with the delivery.",

Numerous factors can influence how well those communications can function...interferences from other devices, temperature, physical blocking, etc.  When your RL and pump first pair together, Loop performs a series of tests that you won't see...they are tuning tests. Basically, RL sends little test messages to the pump and waits for a response. The RL tries this same \"ping\" to the pump a range of various radio frequencies. The range of radio frequencies it tries is based on the pump you've told RL to expect (Omnipod, Medtronic NA/CA, or Medtronic WW).  RL will then record the radio frequencies that provided the strongest response and use that frequency for future pump communications.  Usually this best frequency is pretty constant for any given pump+RL, but during temperature changes it may be that the best frequency is not the one currently set. In the event that RL has problems communicating with the pump, Loop has code built-in that will automatically tell the RL \"Hey, try that tuning pump thing again...maybe there's a better frequency we need to try.\" This retuning is started automatically if pump communications fail for 14 minutes (in other words, two looping cycles).",

Members of Apple's Developer Program can test apps on their own devices prior to submitting the App Store for distribution or sale.  Developers also get access to beta releases of new OS and iOS versions (but please don't use them if you use Loop, they will be incompatible with Loop while in beta release).\n\n\nThe Loop app is not available for download in the App Store.  It needs to be built and installed by the individual users.  This means Loop users need to enroll as an individual (not an organization) in the Apple Developer Program in order to install the Loop app on their iPhone.

You will need to have an Apple ID to sign up for in the Apple Developer Program.\n\n\nFree Membership\n\u2301\n\n\nFree membership comes with an important restriction.  While you can build the Loop app onto your iPhone, the app will expire after 7 days and need to be rebuilt in order to work again.  This means, every 7 days you will need access to an Apple computer, Xcode application, and your iPhone to rebuild the app.\n\n\nYou cannot rebuild the app on day 6 and expect to avoid downtime.  The same app cannot be rebuilt earlier than the 7 days...it will still expire on the 7th day.  You will know your app is expired by the fact that it simply won't open after 7 days.  When you click on it, it will momentarily give you a white screen and then immediately go back to your main iPhone screen.  \n\n\nAnother important distinction is that apps built with a free membership cannot build apps that have Siri capabilities.  Loop has Siri capabilities built-in, so for free developer members, you will have to perform extra steps in order to specifically remove Siri from Loop before building.

If you decide to switch to a paid account after trying out the free account, you will need to rebuild your Loop app in order to sign it with the new paid account.  You will have to do a code customization to remove Siri capabilities in order to build with free accounts.",

            "text": "In summary: This is no problem trying a free account first before you decide to buy a paid developer account. Many Loop users start with a free developer account as they test-drive the Loop. When you build Loop, Xcode will be identifying that specific build of the app using a unique  Bundle Identifier  based on your unique developer account. The great thing about this setup is that when/if you decide to update your Loop app in the future, all of your old Loop app settings and information are saved during the update. Functionally, this is pretty much like you experience when you update any of your existing apps using the iPhone's app store...all the existing info you already had in the app remains unchanged and app just updates right where it was sitting in your iPhone screen.  The magic that makes these seamless updates happen is that  Bundle Identifier . The  Bundle Identifier  is automatically generated for Loop based on the unique developer team that you are signing your Loop app with. This means that the  Bundle Identifier  will change when you switch from a free to a paid membership because the developer team is different.  Why is this worth mentioning?  Because it affects the transition between using a free membership to a paid membership.  If you start with a free account and build Loop, you'll get a Loop app (let's call it Loop1). When you switch to a paid account and build Loop, you'll be building a totally new and separate Loop app onto your phone (let's call it Loop2). Loop2 will know nothing about the settings and information you had stored in Loop1, so you will need to re-enter all your Loop1 settings (basal rates, ISF, carb ratios, etc.) and configurations into Loop2 when it builds.  After getting your new Loop2 app setup, you should delete your old Loop1 from your iPhone that was based on the free developer account to avoid any conflicts.",

Click on ONE of the links below to download your Loop source code.  Wondering which to choose? Read the blue box below\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop: Master branch\n\n\nLoop: Dev branch\n\n\nLoop: Omnipod-testing branch\n (\n---not live yet, don't freak out)\n\n\n\n\n\nMASTER VS DEV -- Which to choose?\n\n\nMaster vs Dev?  What is the difference? The Loop code resides in a website called \nGitHub\n. The various projects in GitHub use \"repositories\". A repository is kind of like a project's bookshelf, holding various books versions (aka branches) of a project. The master branch is considered a stable version of the project. Any new features or options are first tested in a public feature branch or dev (short for \"development\") branch of the Loop. If you hear of \"new features\" being tested, these are things that may be eventually merged into the master branch once any bugs are worked out. If you are choosing to use a testing branch, such as dev or omnipod, please be prepared to update you Loop app to get bug fixes as they are released. \n\n\nOmnipod support in Loop is considered experimental and in-development. If you want to build a version of Loop that supports Omnipod, you will need to select the Omnipod-testing branch download above.\n Keep in mind, dev branch represents a greater likelihood of encountering bugs or glitches. As you encounter those, please check the docs first to see if that issue is already answered. If you think you truly are seeing strange behavior, report the bug to Loop's GitHub by \ncreating a \"New Issue\" here\n. You can also look through the list of known issues already reported, as there is a chance your issue has already been seen by others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES: Best practice is to leave your Loop code in your Downloads folder.  If you store your Loop code in a different folder than Downloads (such as your Documents folder or Desktop), make sure the specified folder is \nnot\n an iCloud drive.  Storing your Loop code in an iCloud drive folder will prevent Loop from building successfully.  How do you know if a folder is an iCloud drive?  Check your System Preferences.  If your System Preferences for iCloud is set as shown below, your Documents and Desktop folders are iCloud drives and \nNOT\n appropriate places to save your Loop download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your browser and settings, your Loop download may or may not automatically unzip.  If it does not unzip automatically, you can right-click on the zip file and choose to \"Open With\" Archive Utility.  This will create a blue folder called \nLoop-master\n.  HOWEVER, if you already have an existing \nLoop-master\n folder from a previous download, the name of the next download will be something like \nLoop-master (1)\n.  The problem with that folder name is that it contains a space...and spaces in the name will cause your Loop build to fail.  So, either delete old copies of Loop before downloading/unzipping or rename the folder(s) to ensure that NO SPACES are in the folder name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Loop project in Xcode\n\u2301\n\n\nGo to your Downloads folder, open the \nLoop-master\n folder (or whatever you named it...double check that the folder does not contain any spaces in the folder name, as described above), and double click on Loop.xcodeproj. For Omnipod Loop, the folder will likely be named \nLoop-omnipod-testing\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA warning may appear asking if you really want to open it, click Open.  Xcode will get itself organized and installed, this may take a few minutes.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce Xcode has finished indexing, the Loop project's various folders and files will appear in the far left column (if you don't see the files/folders, click on the little blue folder icon at the top of that far left column).  At the very top, click on the blue \"Loop\" at the top of the list.  Then click on the box in the middle screen to reveal the targets column.  The four targets we will sign in the upcoming steps are now easily viewable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect your iPhone to Computer\n\u2301\n\n\nConnect your iPhone via cable to the computer, select your iPhone from the very top of the drop down list.  Your \niPhone\u2019s personal name\n should be at the top of the list.  Don't accidentally select the generic iOS simulators listed below your iPhone's name.  \n\n\n\n\nHelpful Tip\n\n\nIf your iPhone has a lock enabled, Xcode will not be able to install Loop app once your phone locks during the build progress.  Please temporarily disable the lock until you finish building Loop app.  Go to your iPhone Settings \n Display \n Brightness \n Auto-Lock and set it to \nNever\n.  You can reset your lock once Loop is done building onto the phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese next steps are usually only needed on the first Loop build; they can be skipped on subsequent builds.\n\n\n\n\nIf this is the first time your iPhone has been plugged in to this computer, you will need to open the iPhone and select \"Trust this Computer\" before your device will be useable in the menu selection.\n\n\nIf this is the first time you are building an app onto this iPhone using this particular Apple developer account, you will need to \u201cregister the device\u201d to your developer account.  The device registration screen, as shown below, may appear when your iPhone is selected.  If these prompts for \"register device\" don't immediately appear, there will be a prompt later to register device.  Either registration prompt, now or later, will work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSigning Targets\n\u2301\n\n\nOnce you select your device (your iPhone's name), we are ready to start signing the four targets. We will start with the Loop target, the first one on the target list.  Under the \"Signing\" area, select the dropdown menu where it currently says \"none\". Choose your team that you'd like to sign with. If you select a team name with (personal team), your app will expire after 7 days. If you select a team name without that (personal team), your app will last a full year.  If you never signed up for a free developer account, you will not have a (personal team) showing. Make sure you keep the \"automatically manage signing\" box checked above the team selection area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you choose your signing team, Xcode will automatically generate provisioning profiles and signing certificates.  If this is the first time you are building on this iPhone with this developer account, you may again be prompted to register the device.  Simply click on the \"Register Device\" button to confirm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA successfully signed target will have a provisioning profile and signing certificate similar to the screenshot below.  Click on each of the three remaining targets, and repeat the signing steps by choosing the same team name as you selected in the first target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Customizations\n\u2301\n\n\nNew Loop users\n: Customizations are not a required part of any Loop build.  As you gain experience in how you use your Loop app, you may want to customize some of the features.  You can always update your Loop app to add customizations at a later time.  Really though, building with the standard, default installation is JUST FINE.\n\n\nIf you want any custom configurations to your Loop or Loop Apple Watch apps, now is the time to make them before you finish with the last step of Loop installation on your iPhone.  Follow the step-by-step instructions on the \nCode Customizations\n page. If you are a person familiar with Apple's swift language, feel free to make your own customizations as well.\n\n\nWhen you've finished your customizations, come on back to this section and continue on with the rest of the build.\n\n\nPair your Apple Watch\n\u2301\n\n\nNew Apple Watch users\n: If you have an unopened Apple watch and want to use it with Loop, first pair the watch with the iPhone before continuing to the next steps.  If you get a new watch after building the Loop app, you'll need to redo your Loop build. (Don't worry, it's as easy as pressing play on your saved Loop project.)\n\n\nExisting Apple Watch users\n: Please update your watchOS prior to building Loop app.  The current version of Loop requires watchOS 4.1 or newer.\n\n\nBuild Loop\n\u2301\n\n\nSigned the four targets? All done with any customizations? Have your Apple watch paired and updated? iPhone is unlocked and plugged into computer?\n\n\nLet\u2019s finish the installation of the Loop app onto your iPhone.  Double check to make sure your iPhone's name is still selected and then press the \u201cplay\u201d button (or build button) to start Xcode on its way.  You\u2019ll see the progression of the build in the status window.  New builds can take about 40 minutes depending on the speed of the computer and internet.  \nJust be patient.\n  The progress will get \"stuck\" on one step for a very long time, and then the others will fly by when that one slow step is done. Not every step is equal in duration. Do not give up on the build. You will be interrupted during the build for the codesign/keychain access prompt discussed below though. However, you can remain useful during the wait by reading the section below titled \"While it's building....\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe aware though! Sometime during your first ever build on a computer, be ready for a codesign/keychain access prompt that you will see part-way through the build process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis prompt above, when you see it, requires you to enter your computer password and then select \"Always Allow\". Normal behavior, this prompt will come up four times in a row even after you enter the correct password. In frustration, people think the prompt must be broken because it keeps reappearing and then people will press deny or cancel.  \nDon't deny.\n  Keep entering your computer password and pressing the Always Allow button...as many times as it takes (four times to be exact; one for each target that Xcode is saving the password for).  After four times of successful password entry, the build will keep proceeding.\n\n\nWhile it is building...read the next section below.\n\n\nWhile it's building...\n\u2301\n\n\nWhile you are waiting for this build to finish, please take a moment to read this section. You're about to see a really crazy cool and amazing app on your phone that you've waited a long time for. It will suck you in immediately. And you will be so excited by how easy it is to use, that you will push your chair back from this computer screen and forget about any further instructions.\n\n\nDON'T DO THAT!!\n\n\n\nDON'T BE THAT PERSON!!\n\n\n\nThere is SUPER valuable information contained in these documents that really needs to be reviewed and read. Such as:\n\n\n\n\nHow to resolve any \nbuild errors\n that you might get\n\n\nWhat all the settings mean in your Loop app and what reasonable ones might be\n\n\nHow to enter carbs and what carb absorption duration means to bolusing\n\n\nHow to handle sick days\n\n\nHow to use override targets\n\n\nWhat the difference is between insulin models\n\n\n\n\nOnce your build is successful, DO NOT JUST GO ENTERING SETTINGS IN BY YOURSELF!\n\u2301\n\n\nInstead, work step-by-step to make sure you get through these pieces of helpful information:\n\n\n\n\nFor USA Loopers, read the \nJaeb Observational Study page\n\n\nRead the \nHealth Permissions page\n to make sure you get your Loop data recording properly\n\n\nStart with following the step-by-step directions for setting up your Loop correctly. THIS IS IMPORTANT! There are safety considerations in how you setup your app...so please follow along with the setup guides. \nLoop App Overview and Setup Pages\n\n\n\n\nAnd longer term:\n\n\n\n\nBookmark \nLoopDocs.org\n and \nLoopTips.org\n so that you can come back to these resources to learn more if you have any questions.\n\n\nJoin the \nLooped Group\n in Facebook\n\n\nJoin the \nLoop Users group\n in case of urgent notifications\n\n\n\n\nMany of the greatest challenges in starting Loop can be helped by reading the pages in these docs and in Looptips.org. Please don't underestimate the help that a little reading can provide.\n\n\nBuild Succeeded\n\u2301\n\n\nIf the build is successful, your brand new Loop app will have a screen open immediately on the iPhone asking about allowing Loop notifications and Health App access. Allow Loop to send you notifications. In the next screen that follows that, click on the \nTurn All Categories On\n line and then click \nAllow\n in the upper right corner.\n\n\nAnd now that you're built, I'm going to remind you again to use the guides to help you setup and understand your Loop app:\n\nLoop App Overview and Setup Pages\n\n\n\n\nFirst time builders\n\n\nIf this is the first time you have installed an app on your iPhone using your developer account, you may get a warning like below.  Don't worry, Loop installed on the phone but needs you to do an extra step on the phone before Loop app can open.  Just follow the directions shown in the warning for what you need to do on your iPhone, and the issue resolves very quickly.  Click ok and you can safely disconnect your iPhone from the computer.  (If you don\u2019t get a warning and the Loop app installs but does not open, you may still need to go to Settings-\nGeneral-\nDevice Management and enable trust for your Developer Account.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild Failed\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you get a message that your build failed, you're likely going to see a list of red alerts on your left-hand column of Loop app. Those messages will be the key to resolving your build error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need to go to the \nBuild Errors\n page to resolve the error message. Read your error message(s), find the matching error in the Build Errors page's images and descriptions, and follow the directions for repairing the error.\n\n\nNext Step: Jaeb's Loop Observational Study\n\u2301\n\n\nYou're done building your Loop app...but first, if you are a USA Loop user, please read about the \nJaeb Observational Study\n before moving onto \nLoop App setup",

If you store your Loop code in a different folder than Downloads (such as your Documents folder or Desktop), make sure the specified folder is  not  an iCloud drive.  Storing your Loop code in an iCloud drive folder will prevent Loop from building successfully.  How do you know if a folder is an iCloud drive?  Check your System Preferences.  If your System Preferences for iCloud is set as shown below, your Documents and Desktop folders are iCloud drives and  NOT  appropriate places to save your Loop download.   \nDepending on your browser and settings, your Loop download may or may not automatically unzip.  If it does not unzip automatically, you can right-click on the zip file and choose to \"Open With\" Archive Utility.  This will create a blue folder called  Loop-master .  HOWEVER, if you already have an existing  Loop-master  folder from a previous download, the name of the next download will be something like  Loop-master (1) .  The problem with that folder name is that it contains a space...and spaces in the name will cause your Loop build to fail.  So, either delete old copies of Loop before downloading/unzipping or rename the folder(s) to ensure that NO SPACES are in the folder name.",

You'll see the warnings and alerts in the left-hand column of the Xcode window.\n\n\nYellow warnings\n do not cause the build to fail, those are just warnings.  Occasionally, a Loop version may have some minor discrepencies that cause a yellow alert...ignore those. Do not try to do anything to fix those...leave them alone.\n\n\nRed error alerts\n \n will have to be resolved before you can successfully build Loop app. The steps below explain how to resolve them based on the messages you are seeing.\n\n\nStart with the obvious error causes\n\u2301\n\n\nBefore you start trying to resolve your red errors...start with the most obvious things that can cause a red error message:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT USE BETA VERSIONS.  If you are using an iOS beta version or an Xcode beta version, your Loop will not build. If you have Xcode beta, uninstall it and get regular Xcode. If you have iOS beta on your iPhone, you will need to restore your iPhone entirely. You can restore to either (1) the last non-beta backup version you saved or (2) restore as a new iPhone (default settings). Yes, deleting iOS beta is a pain...so don't install it in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you check for Xcode updates in your computer's App Store? The most current version of Xcode is 10.1. Older versions of Xcode will not work with newer iOS. Failing to update Xcode is a frequent cause of red error messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a fresh download of Loop code, don't just recycle an old download that you built with a long time ago. That old version may not be compatible with new iOS and new Xcode versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using a free developer account, you need to have finished the \ncode customizations to remove Siri capabilties\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosting for help\n\u2301\n\n\nSTOP!!  Read this section! Important!\n\n\nBefore you post in Zulipchat or Looped Group asking for help with build errors, \ndo your work first\n. The build errors listed below (and the obvious checks listed above) are very successful \nIF PEOPLE READ THIS PAGE\n. The volunteer group of people answering questions in Looped and Zulipchat would love to spend more time on improving Loop in other ways than answering build error questions that can be answered by using this page as a first step.\n\n\nTherefore, first use the error topics (listed in sections below) to try to resolve your build error yourself. Then, if you need to post for help because this page did not fix your problem, you'll need to include information with the post so we (the troubleshooters) know you read this page and where you are in your troubleshooting attempts:\n\n\n\n\nVersion of Xcode you are using\n\n\nVersion of Loop you are building with\n\n\nVersion of iOS on your Loop iPhone\n\n\nSpecify if you are using a free or paid account, and if free...confirm you deleted Siri capabilities\n\n\nIn your post, confirm you are not using an Xcode beta or iOS beta version (so we don't have to ask, actually type \"I am not using beta versions\"...this will save a lot of time and hassle)\n\n\nScreenshots of your Xcode window and/or Terminal window showing your error and any messages you've seen while working through the build errors/solutions.\n\n\nList which of the fixes listed below you have already tried.\n\n\n\n\nHelpful tip #1: Shift-Command-4 will give you a little screenshot tool that you can click-and-drag to highlight the area you'd like to screenshot. When you release the drag, the screenshot will save to your desktop so you can include it in your post. Phone photos of your computer screen won't likely be of sufficient clarity to read the needed information.\n\n\nHelpful tip #2: When taking screenshots for a post, include the whole Xcode window. Don't zoom in on any one area. There is information in all parts of the Xcode window that are helpful to the troubleshooters, so it saves time to simply see the whole Xcode window at once.\n\n\nFind your error message(s)\n\u2301\n\n\nTo start your error fix (assuming you didn't have one of the obvious issues listed above), the key is to (1) \nREAD THE ERROR MESSAGE\n and then (2) \nFIND YOUR MESSAGE IN ONE OF THE TOPICS BELOW\n.\n\n\nHere's a super tip: Merely seeing the \"exit code\" in Xcode is not enough information to discern what error is causing your build to fail. Look at the detailed message to really help guide your search for the matching solution.\n\n\nNotice how in the screenshots in the topics below, there are red circles highlighting certain error messages? Read your error messages similar to where those red circles are in the screenshots below. Once you find your error message (hint: not \"exit code\"), you can either:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake the error message from your Xcode screen and use LoopDoc's search function to enter in some of that phrase to bring up the appropriate solution topic, or\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake the error message from your Xcode screen and read through EACH OF THE TOPICS BELOW. Check each of the red circles to see if you have a match. Kind of like a matching puzzle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you see \"Invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)\" in your error message, use the search tool in LoopDocs with simply \"invalid active\". You will get a couple links and one is the Command Line Tools fix for that error message. Click on the link and you'll find your solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild Failed in frameworks\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you see a \nCartfile failure\n and several other red errors (in particular saying there is \"no such module 'LoopKit'\"), double click on the Cartfile error message.  If it says that the build failed in one of the schemes, as shown in the screenshot below, then you need to open Terminal app.  You will use the command \ncd ~/downloads/loop-master \n carthage update\n.  NOTE:  YOU MAY HAVE TO CHANGE THE COMMAND SLIGHTLY.  If your loop folder isn't named loop-master and instead is loop-master-2 or loop-dev or some other folder name...change the command to match your folder's actual name. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarthage update will take about 15 minutes to run successfully.  A successful carthage update will look like the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce carthage update has run successfully, you can return to Xcode and press the build button again.  Your project should build successfully.\n\n\nIf your carthage update fails, try opening Terminal app and running these commands to clear out your carthage cache and saved derived data in Xcode:\n\n\nrm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.carthage.CarthageKit\n and \nrm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData\n\n\nAfter running those commands, retry the \ncd ~/downloads/loop-master \n carthage update\n (remembering to update the name of your Loop download folder, as needed).\n\n\nSiri Capabilities\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: \"Your development team does not support the Siri capability\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: You need to customize your code to remove Siri capabilities when you are building Loop with a free developer account. See the Code Customization section \nhere\n for directions.\n\n\nPending Certificate Request\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: \"You already have a current iOS Development certificate or a pending certificate request.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: This error message has just recently started to appear for some new Loop builders. To resolve the issue, please login to your Developer account at \ndeveloper.apple.com\n and then click on \"Certificates, Identifiers \n Profiles\".  Under that screen, you will see \"Development\" under the \"Certificates\" section in column on the left.  You will need to click on the certificates, and choose to \"revoke\" from the options that show after you click on the certificate. Confirm the warning message that will appear asking \"Do you want to revoke the certificate?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you do that, return to Xcode and open up Xcode preferences.  Under the Accounts section of Preferences, click on the minus sign to delete your Apple ID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-enter your Apple ID (yes...add that account right back that you literally just deleted), return to your Loop's target signing areas in Xcode and your error message should have resolved itself now as a new certificate will have been issued and a provisioning profile should have been created automatically.\n\n\nFor double measure, you can verify that the iOS development certificates are all in good working order by clicking on your \"Manage Certificates\" in your Xcode Preferences, Accounts and viewing the iOS development Certificates.  You should have one for your account that has a clean status similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot using Xcode 10.1\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: The error message may change over time and Xcode versions...currently if you use iOS 12 and have not updated to Xcode 10.1, you will receive the following errors when you try to build:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: You will need to go to your computer's App Store and install the Xcode app update.\n\n\nMissing Command Line Tools\n\u2301\n\n\nError message:  \"\nInvalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)\n\" or \"\nunable to find utility \"xcodebuild\", not a developer tool or in PATH\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: Go to your Xcode preferences and under the Locations tab, select \"Xcode 10.1\" in the dropdown menu for Command Line Tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand CodeSign failed\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: \"\nerrSecInternalComponent,  Command CodeSign failed with a nonzero exit code\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:  This error message is likely due to inadvertently saying \"no\" to allowing Keychain Access or changing your computer or AppleID password. Regardless, the solution is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nClose Xcode\n\n\nOpen your Keychain Access application (found in Applications within the Utilities folder, similar to where Terminal app is found)\n\n\nIn the upper left corner of keychain access, make sure you have the keychain \nlogin\n highlighted and then click the large lock icon above the keychains area (High Sierra users) or right-click the lock next to the \nlogin\n (Mojave macOS users).  Click the lock closed, and then click the lock to open it again. You will be prompted for a password.  Enter your computer admin password.  Close Keychain Access app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen your Loop project again in Xcode.\n\n\nIn the main Xcode menu (grey menu bar at the very top of your Apple display area), select the word \nProduct\n and then select the option for \nClean\n. (keyboard shortcut is shift-command-k)\n\n\nNow try rebuilding your Loop app.  If you ever get prompted again to allow Xcode access to Keychain, make sure to Always Allow.\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper License Update\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: \"\nThe Apple Developer Program License Agreement has been updated,  In order to access certain membership resources, you must accept the latest license agreement.\n\"\n\n\nSolution: You'll need to log onto your developer account at \ndeveloper.apple.com\n and accept the latest license agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarthage update message\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you see a message about updating carthage version, open Terminal app and enter the following command \nbrew update \n brew upgrade carthage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrecognized arguments: --cache-builds\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: \"\nUnrecognized arguments: --cache-builds\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: Please open your Terminal app found in the Applications\nUtilities folder and then enter \n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n  Confirm installation by pressing enter, and then typing in your computer password.  When the installation finishes, use the command \nbrew link --overwrite carthage\n.  After those two steps, you can close out Terminal app, return to Xcode and press the build/play button again.\n\n\nAbort with Payload\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: \"\nAbort with payload\n\"  Your app will only open briefly with a white screen and then close, if you build with this error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: This error message is caused by either\n\n\n\n\nSaving Loop download folder into an iCloud mapped drive, or\n\n\nHaving a space in the name of your Loop download folder.\n\n\n\n\nRename the folder to have no spaces and/or move it back to the Downloads folder, then rebuild.\n\n\nApple Watch: Loop app not appearing\n\u2301\n\n\nError: \nApple watch app is not appearing\n.\n\n\nSolution: Usually because you have not updated to watchOS prior to when you built Loop, or you didn't have your Apple watch paired at the time of building Loop.  Don't forget to open the iPhone's Watch app, select My Watch tab on the bottom left, scroll all the way down, and click \nInstall\n for the Loop app listed at the very bottom under \"available apps\".\n\n\nApple Watch: Loop app not installing\n\u2301\n\n\nError: \nThe Loop app appears on the list of app available to install on the watch, but when you press \"install\", and it goes through the animation of filling in the circle while it's installing, but then at the end it just toggles back to saying \"INSTALL\"\n.\n\n\nSolution:  Plug your iPhone into the computer and start Xcode.  On your watch, look for a prompt that says \"Trust this computer\".  Scroll down on the watchface and select the \"Trust\" button.  Now rebuild your Loop app in Xcode, but look for a pop-up message that warns you that the Watch isn't registered with the Developer portal.  Click on the \"register\" button that is in the pop-up window and proceed with the Loop app building again.\n\n\n\n\nWatchOS 5 appears to be an issue for some users currently.  If your Loop app is not properly installing on your watch using watchOS 5, please reopen Loop in Xcode and change the deployment targets in the WatchApp and WatchApp Extension targets to a Deployment Target of 5.0.  Rebuild and your watch app should install properly.",

You can restore to either (1) the last non-beta backup version you saved or (2) restore as a new iPhone (default settings). Yes, deleting iOS beta is a pain...so don't install it in the first place.    Did you check for Xcode updates in your computer's App Store? The most current version of Xcode is 10.1. Older versions of Xcode will not work with newer iOS. Failing to update Xcode is a frequent cause of red error messages.    Get a fresh download of Loop code, don't just recycle an old download that you built with a long time ago. That old version may not be compatible with new iOS and new Xcode versions.    If you are using a free developer account, you need to have finished the  code customizations to remove Siri capabilties .",

The build errors listed below (and the obvious checks listed above) are very successful  IF PEOPLE READ THIS PAGE . The volunteer group of people answering questions in Looped and Zulipchat would love to spend more time on improving Loop in other ways than answering build error questions that can be answered by using this page as a first step.  Therefore, first use the error topics (listed in sections below) to try to resolve your build error yourself. Then, if you need to post for help because this page did not fix your problem, you'll need to include information with the post so we (the troubleshooters) know you read this page and where you are in your troubleshooting attempts:   Version of Xcode you are using  Version of Loop you are building with  Version of iOS on your Loop iPhone  Specify if you are using a free or paid account, and if free...confirm you deleted Siri capabilities  In your post, confirm you are not using an Xcode beta or iOS beta version (so we don't have to ask, actually type \"I am not using beta versions\"...this will save a lot of time and hassle)  Screenshots of your Xcode window and/or Terminal window showing your error and any messages you've seen while working through the build errors/solutions.  List which of the fixes listed below you have already tried.   Helpful tip #1: Shift-Command-4 will give you a little screenshot tool that you can click-and-drag to highlight the area you'd like to screenshot. When you release the drag, the screenshot will save to your desktop so you can include it in your post. Phone photos of your computer screen won't likely be of sufficient clarity to read the needed information.  Helpful tip #2: When taking screenshots for a post, include the whole Xcode window. Don't zoom in on any one area. There is information in all parts of the Xcode window that are helpful to the troubleshooters, so it saves time to simply see the whole Xcode window at once.",

Here's a super tip: Merely seeing the \"exit code\" in Xcode is not enough information to discern what error is causing your build to fail. Look at the detailed message to really help guide your search for the matching solution.  Notice how in the screenshots in the topics below, there are red circles highlighting certain error messages? Read your error messages similar to where those red circles are in the screenshots below. Once you find your error message (hint: not \"exit code\"), you can either:    Take the error message from your Xcode screen and use LoopDoc's search function to enter in some of that phrase to bring up the appropriate solution topic, or    Take the error message from your Xcode screen and read through EACH OF THE TOPICS BELOW. Check each of the red circles to see if you have a match. Kind of like a matching puzzle.    For example, if you see \"Invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)\" in your error message, use the search tool in LoopDocs with simply \"invalid active\". You will get a couple links and one is the Command Line Tools fix for that error message. Click on the link and you'll find your solution.",

            "text": "Code Customizations\n\u2301\n\n\nBased on Loop users\u2019 experience, there are some customizations that you may want to incorporate ahead of building your Loop app and Apple Watch app.  These customizations must be done prior to building the Loop app onto your iPhone, they cannot be done from within the app itself.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Every effort will be made to update the line numbers as the code is updated, but there may be times where the screenshots and line numbers are slightly different than the current version of Loop code.  These instructions have been updated for Loop v1.9.4.\n\n\n\n\nDisable Siri Capabilities\n\u2301\n\n\nFree developer accounts will not be able to build Loop app while Siri capabilities are turned on.  In order to turn those features off, you will need to remove the Siri entitlements manually.\n\n\nIn the upper left toolbar of Xcode is a \"find\" option (magnifying glass just below the build - play button), search for 'Siri'.  Two files will be returned; Loop.entitlements and WatchApp Extension.entitlements.  For each of those files, you will need to click on the file name and then delete the Siri Entitlements files by clicking on the minus sign to the right of the word \"Siri\". Once you delete the Siri entitlement in those two files, you'll be able to sign the four targets and build with the free developer account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable Authentication for Bolusing\n\u2301\n\n\nDepending on your iPhone preferences and model, you may have Face ID or Touch ID enabled.  Those security features will also be used to authenticate bolus delivery in Loop.  You can choose to disable authentication (i.e., not require Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode for bolusing) through the following code customization:\n\n\nModify Line 191 in the Loop\nView Controllers\nBolusViewController.swift.  Add the \nfalse \n as shown in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkout Range Duration\n\u2301\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like more than just the standard 1 or 2 hour duration for the Workout Range, you can add or modify the code to add another time interval or edit the existing ones.\n\n\nGo to the Loop\nExtensions\nUIAlertController.swift and modify Line 32.  The default has 1 and 2 hours as shown where the arrow is pointing in the screenshot.  You can edit those to whatever duration you want (in units of hours) and add a duration if you prefer.  If you\u2019d like 1, 2, and 3 hours options...simply edit the numbers in the brackets to read [1, 2, 3]. It is possible to enter less than 1 hour intervals such as 15 min, 30 min, 45 min by editing the brackets to read [0.25, 0.5, 0.75].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Carb Absorption Times\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nLoop\u2019s default carb absorption times are based on the high, medium, and low glycemic index absorption curves presented in \nThink Like A Pancreas\n by Gary Scheiner.  Currently the lollipop icon is set for 2 hours, taco icon for 3 hours, and pizza icon for 4 hours.  \n\n\nYou can modify these defaults to suit your needs, however modification of these values it not as helpful/common as previous Loop versions.  Ever since Loop v1.4, Loop has included dynamic carb absorption means that Loop will start with your entered carb absorption time, multiply it by 1.5, and then dynamically adjust the absorption time (either shorter or longer) based on the observed BG impacts.  So, typically, most people are finding that modification of the default carb absorption times is no longer necessary.\n\n\nIf you would like to modify those defaults, you can do so in the Loop\nManagers\nLoopDataManager.swift Lines 65-67.  Note the times are in hours, not minutes, in the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutral Temp Basals\n\u2301\n\n\nWith the default installation, when Loop calculates that the recommended temp basal matches the basal rate in your Loop basal rate schedule (aka \"neutral temp basal\") rather than setting a temp basal, Loop will cancel any currently running temp basal and let the pump just run the scheduled basal.  Assuming you are using Loop v1.9.3 and the \"save to pump...\" command to make basal rate schedule edits, Loop and the pump will be matching and this will not cause any issues.\n\n\nIf you would like Loop to instead set neutral temp basals, you can edit lines 151 and 155 in the Loop\nManagers\nDoseMath.swift file to read \nreturn self\n as shown in screenshot below.  This will result in Loop setting neutral temp basals when the recommended temp basal matches the Loop's basal schedule.  The potential downsides are slightly more battery consumption, and slightly greater opportunity for temp basal failures as it is a longer pump communication than simply canceling a temp basal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExponential Insulin Curve\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Exponential Insulin Curve Models (Rapid-Acting Adult, Rapid-Acting Child, and Fiasp) are defaulted to an insulin duration of 360 minutes...but the peak activity of the various curves differs:\n\n\n\n\nRapid-acting adult curve peaks at 75 minutes\n\n\nRapid-acting child curve peaks at 65 minutes\n\n\nFiasp peaks curve peaks at 55 minutes\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to customize these values, you can adjust them on Lines 22-38 in the Common\nModels\nInsulin\nExponentialInsulinModelPreset.swift file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop Logo\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you want an app logo other than the default green circle for your Loop app, you can easily customize this.  To make it easy to generate the correct sizes of icons, you can use a site like \nappicon.build\n and just drag and drop your source image. The source image needs to be 1024 pixels x 1024 pixels.  The site will email you a zip file.  Double click the zip file, choose the \u201cios\u201d folder, and copy the contents of the Appicon.appiconset as shown highlighted below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow navigate to the corresponding Loop folder as shown below.  Replace the contents of the Appicon.appiconset with your copied images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can confirm the successful change by looking in Xcode.  You should see your custom logo in the Appicon set now.  You will also likely see a yellow alert that there are \u201cunassigned children\u201d.  This alert will not prevent your app from building, it\u2019s simply because the zip file contained more sizes of images than Loop app uses.  You can just leave the unassigned images as is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Watch Customizations\n\u2301\n\n\nRecommended Bolus Autofill\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Apple Watch's default is to autofill to 75% of the recommended bolus.  If you wish, you can customize so that the watch autofills a different percentage. To do this, the multiplier can be changed from 0.75 to a value of your choice. A value of 1 will autofill 100% of the recommended bolus. A value of 0 will autofill 0% of the recommended bolus.   Go to the Watchapp Extension\nControllers\nBolusInterfaceController.swift. Edit the section of line 96 for your customization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust sensitivity of digital crown for carb and bolus entry\n\u2301\n\n\nThe rate of change of the carb and bolus entry pickers when using the digital crown can be altered. You'll need to edit two lines in files within the WatchApp Extension\nControllers folder.  In BolusInterfaceController.swift edit line 174, and in AddCarbsInterfaceController.swift edit line 215. The 1/24 value is the ratio of rotations of the crown to the amount of change in the value. Changing it to 1/12 would mean that twice as many turns would be needed for the same amount of carb or bolus entry.",

The update steps are:\n\n\n\n\nUpdate macOS, Xcode, iOS, and/or watchOS\n\n\nDownload updated Loop code\n\n\nOpen in Xcode, sign targets\n\n\nAdd optional code customizations\n\n\nBuild onto your iPhone\n\n\nResolve Build Errors\n\n\n\n\nYou do not have to delete your existing app. The new app update will simply overwrite the old app and save all your old settings and information.\n\n\nWhen to Update\n\u2301\n\n\nYou will have to rebuild your Loop app at a minimum once every 12 months. The apps built and signed by you in Xcode with a paid developer account will only last for 12 months before they expire and need rebuilding. So, at least once per year you will have to rebuild your app and go through this update process.\n\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, you do not \nhave to\n update your Loop app until you are ready to grab new features. However, we encourage regular updates when a new version is released because they often contain bug fixes or improvements which may increase operational stability.\n\n\nStep 1: Update OS and Xcode\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you miss macOS or Xcode updates, you may run into build problems. Do not skip these steps before updating Loop.\n \n\n\nBetween Loop app builds, there's a high liklihood that Apple has updated one or more of the systems involved in your Loop app. You need to check the following for updates to prevent build conflicts during your update of Loop:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdate your macOS by clicking on your apple icon in the computer's upper left corner and then selecting \"Software Update\" button. If your macOS needs an update, this will lead you there. Do this step first before checking for Xcode udpates in the next update step. The macOS needs to be updated to the most current in some situations in order to support the most recent Xcode.  You need macOS High Sierra or Mojave at a minimum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdate your Xcode by opening the App Store application in your computer and selecting the \"Updates\" from the left-hand column. If an Xcode update is available, install the update before moving on with Loop updates.  You need Xcode 10.1 at a minimum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdate your iPhone's iOS. To check if an iOS update is available, click on your iPhone's Settings, General, Software Update and then click on \"install update\" button if one is available. You need iOS 11.1 at a minimum, but iOS 12 or later is recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdate your Apple Watch's watchOS. To check if a watchOS update is available, click on your Watch App in your paired iPhone and then go to Settings, General, Software Update and then click on \"install update\" if one is available. You need watchOS 4.1 at a minimum, but watchOS 5 or later is recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Download Updated Loop Code\n\u2301\n\n\nAfter you've finished the updates to your devices listed above, you can move onto downloading updated Loop code. You will not be simply using your old downloaded Loop code (and in fact, you can delete those old folders now if you want). Click on \nONE\n of the links below to download an updated versions of Loop code (most people will use Master, see note below for explanation):\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop: Master branch source code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOR\n\n\nLoop: Dev branch source code\n\n\n\n\nFYI: The Loop source code resides in \nGitHub\n within a repository.  A repository is kind of like a project's bookshelf, holding various books (aka branches) of a project.  The master branch is considered a stable version.  Any new features or options are first tested in a dev (short for \"development\") branch of the Loop.  New or inexperienced users should not build from the dev branch of Loop.  So if you hear of \"new features in dev\", these are things that may be eventually merged into the master branch once any bugs are worked out.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES: Best practice is to leave your Loop code in your Downloads folder.  If you store your Loop code a different folder than Downloads (such as your Documents folder or Desktop), make sure the specified folder is \nnot\n an iCloud drive.  Storing your Loop code in an iCloud drive folder will prevent Loop from building successfully.  How do you know if a folder is an iCloud drive?  Check your System Preferences.  If your System Preferences for iCloud is set as shown below, your Documents and Desktop folders are iCloud drives and \nNOT\n appropriate places to save your Loop download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your browser and settings, your Loop download may or may not automatically unzip.  If it does not unzip automatically, you can right-click on the zip file and choose to \"Open With\" Archive Utility.  This will create a blue folder called \nLoop-master\n.  HOWEVER, if you already have an existing \nLoop-master\n folder from a previous download, the name of the next download will be something like \nLoop-master (1)\n.  The problem with that folder name is that it contains a space...and spaces in the name will cause your Loop build to fail.  So, either delete old copies of Loop before downloading/unzipping or rename the folder(s) to ensure that NO SPACES are in the folder name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Open in Xcode, Sign Targets\n\u2301\n\n\nDouble click the Loop folder in your Downloads folder, and then double click the \nLoop.xcodeproj\n to open the Loop project in Xcode. Navigate, as you did when you originally built the app, to the four target areas. Sign the four targets with your developer team name. Remember that the \"(personal team)\" in the signing team's name indicates that is a free account and the app will only last for 7 days if you sign with that team name.\n\n\nStep 3: Add Code Customizations\n\u2301\n\n\nAdd or redo any code customizations, if needed.  These will not be carried over automatically from the old app.  Be sure to read up in the \ncode customizations section\n before building, as there may be new customizations available since the previous build.\n\n\nIf you are building with a free account, you will have to remove the Siri capabilities in order to build.\n\n\nStep 4: Build to your iPhone\n\u2301\n\n\nPlug your iPhone into the computer, unlock it so that the phone does not fall asleep during the build process.  You can find this setting under Settings, Display \n Brightness, Auto-Lock, set to \"Never\". You can return to your normal lock settings after the build is done.  \n\n\nSelect your iPhone from the top of the device list near Loop's window's upper left area, and then press the triangle \"build\" button similar to how you did your original Loop build.\n\n\nNOW BE PATIENT.\n  Loop will take a long time to build; between 25-45 minutes depending on your computer.  The Loop build process will appear to stall or hang a very long time on one build step in particular. Do not worry. This is normal. One step will take a significant amount of time relative to all the other steps. Once that long step is done, the rest will fly by fairly quickly.\n\n\nAt the end of all the steps, you will either get a Build Succeeded or Build Failed message.\n\n\n\n\nIf your build suceeded, you can unplug your phone and move on with Looping. Your new Loop version will be displayed in the top of your Loop Settings screen.\n\n\nIf your build failed, you will need to go to Step 5 below.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Resolve Build Errors\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you get any red build errors or a \"Loop Build Failed\" message, please check \nthis section\n for fixes.",

Between Loop app builds, there's a high liklihood that Apple has updated one or more of the systems involved in your Loop app. You need to check the following for updates to prevent build conflicts during your update of Loop:    update your macOS by clicking on your apple icon in the computer's upper left corner and then selecting \"Software Update\" button. If your macOS needs an update, this will lead you there. Do this step first before checking for Xcode udpates in the next update step. The macOS needs to be updated to the most current in some situations in order to support the most recent Xcode.  You need macOS High Sierra or Mojave at a minimum.    update your Xcode by opening the App Store application in your computer and selecting the \"Updates\" from the left-hand column. If an Xcode update is available, install the update before moving on with Loop updates.  You need Xcode 10.1 at a minimum.    update your iPhone's iOS. To check if an iOS update is available, click on your iPhone's Settings, General, Software Update and then click on \"install update\" button if one is available. You need iOS 11.1 at a minimum, but iOS 12 or later is recommended.    update your Apple Watch's watchOS. To check if a watchOS update is available, click on your Watch App in your paired iPhone and then go to Settings, General, Software Update and then click on \"install update\" if one is available.

You will not be simply using your old downloaded Loop code (and in fact, you can delete those old folders now if you want). Click on  ONE  of the links below to download an updated versions of Loop code (most people will use Master, see note below for explanation):   Loop: Master branch source code    OR  Loop: Dev branch source code   FYI: The Loop source code resides in  GitHub  within a repository.  A repository is kind of like a project's bookshelf, holding various books (aka branches) of a project.  The master branch is considered a stable version.  Any new features or options are first tested in a dev (short for \"development\") branch of the Loop.  New or inexperienced users should not build from the dev branch of Loop.  So if you hear of \"new features in dev\", these are things that may be eventually merged into the master branch once any bugs are worked out.   IMPORTANT NOTES: Best practice is to leave your Loop code in your Downloads folder.  If you store your Loop code a different folder than Downloads (such as your Documents folder or Desktop), make sure the specified folder is  not  an iCloud drive.  Storing your Loop code in an iCloud drive folder will prevent Loop from building successfully.  How do you know if a folder is an iCloud drive?  Check your System Preferences.  If your System Preferences for iCloud is set as shown below, your Documents and Desktop folders are iCloud drives and  NOT  appropriate places to save your Loop download.   \nDepending on your browser and settings, your Loop download may or may not automatically unzip.  If it does not unzip automatically, you can right-click on the zip file and choose to \"Open With\" Archive Utility.  This will create a blue folder called  Loop-master .  HOWEVER, if you already have an existing  Loop-master  folder from a previous download, the name of the next download will be something like  Loop-master (1) .  The problem with that folder name is that it contains a space...and spaces in the name will cause your Loop build to fail.  So, either delete old copies of Loop before downloading/unzipping or rename the folder(s) to ensure that NO SPACES are in the folder name.",

If you are using a Medtronic pump, you can follow along for the rest of this page. If, however, you are using an Omnipod pump, please head over to \nthis page\n instead.\n\n\nPrepare Medtronic Pump\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nBefore you begin the rest of the setup process, there are several steps on your Medtronic pump that you will need to complete prior to moving on with Loop setup. \nDO NOT SKIP THESE STEPS OR YOUR LOOP WILL NOT WORK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn off Patterns under the basal menu settings. This will force Loop to use your \"Standard\" basal rate schedule.\n\n\nMake sure your standard basal rate schedule is up-to-date and accurate. Loop will automatically import your pump's existing standard basal rate schedule when you add your pump in the subsequent parts of this page. \nIf you change basal rates later...make sure to make those changes in the Loop app and use Loop to save the changes back to the pump.  If you make changes directly in the pump, Loop will not automatically know about those changes and you will cause a mismatch.\n\n\nSet your pump's \nTemp Basal Type\n to \nInsulin Rate (U/hr)\n. Do NOT use percentage. Your Loop will not run unless your temp basal type is set to units/hour.\n\n\nMake sure your maximum basal rate and maximum bolus (those are particular settings in the pump) are reasonably set for your particular needs. For new Loop users, a maximum basal rate equal to approximately 2-4 times your highest scheduled basal rate is a good starting point as you learn Loop and dial in your other settings. You can adjust as your comfort and use of Loop develop.\n\n\nSet Remote Devices to \nON\n and enter any random ID (000000 will work). This setting is found in the pump's Utilities menu (for x23 continue to Connect Devices, Remotes) and turn \nON\n the Remote Options.\n\n\nCancel any currently running extended or dual wave boluses.  Loop cannot loop with those running.\n\n\nMake sure the other settings in your pump, such as bolus wizard settings, are up-to-date so that if you stop using Loop, those settings will be accurate for non-Loop traditional pump use.\n\n\n\n\nSelect Pump Type\n\u2301\n\n\nLet\u2019s start by clicking on the Loop Settings button in the tool bar at the bottom of your Loop app. It looks like a little sprocket. On the settings screen that opens, click on \nAdd Pump\n and select the \nMedtronic pump\n option that appears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPump Pairing\n\u2301\n\n\nYou now need to follow a few simple screen prompts to add your Medtronic pump to Loop:\n\n\n\n\nMake sure your RileyLink is turned on and nearby, then you will see a RileyLink listed in this area of the settings.  Actually, you will see a list of any RileyLinks that are in the nearby area. Slide on the toggle for your RileyLink.\n\n\nAdd your pump's region, color, and serial number.\n\n\nClick the \nContinue\n button to finish the addition of your pump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor x23 and x54 Medtronic pump users only\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor x23 and x54 Medtronic pump users, there is a packet of information special to those pumps called MySentry messages. If you have never setup this part of the pump previously, you may see a screen, called \"Pump Broadcasts\", at this point in the setup process.\nFollow the directions on the screen.

When you press suspend delivery, all insulin delivery will stop indefinitely. A banner notice will appear on the Loop's main screen when insulin delivery is suspended. You will need to press the \nResume Delivery\n button to resume your scheduled basal rate and let Loop get back to action.

By clicking on this line, you can clear or \"snooze\" the alarm status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReservoir: Pods do not report the volume of insulin remaining in the reservoir until there is less than 50 units remaining.

The headings will match the flow of the screen, top to bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first circled section covers your Loop's closed/open loop status and Loop's Issue Report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second circled section is the configuration section. This section contains a lot of really important settings that control how your Loop will calculate your predicted BG curve. Given the importance of your predicted BG curve to Loop's actions, please make sure you read over this page carefully to know how to navigate the selections and entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosed/Open Loop\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Closed Loop switch controls whether Loop automatically enacts its recommended temporary basal adjustments (closed loop mode) or whether you have to manually tap to enact the recommendations (open loop mode). In addition to the visual indicator on this switch discussed below, the \nLoop's status icon on the main screen\n will also appear differently depending on the mode selected. Open loop mode will have an incomplete circle for the Loop's status icon.\n. \n\n\nOpen Loop Mode\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Closed Loop switch is in the (Off\n   ) position, Loop WILL NOT enact recommended temp basals automatically. Instead, Loop will display recommended temp basals on the main status display, just above the blood glucose graph. This is called \nopen loop\n, and is a good way to understand how Loop will function, and what type of recommendations it would make. If you click on the recommended temp basal line while in open loop mode, Loop will implement the temp basal.\n\n\nClosed Loop Mode\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen the Closed Loop switch is in the (\n   On) position, Loop WILL automatically enact recommended temp basals on the configured insulin pump. This is known as \nclosed loop\n. Typically, Loop will show the recommended temp basal just above the blood glucose graph prior to automatically enacting it. It may take a minute or so for the Loop to enact the recommended basal. Once the temp basal has been enacted successfully on the pump, the recommended temp basal will disappear from the screen and the new temp basal rate will be represented in the insulin delivery graphs.\n\n\nIssue Report\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you run into problems or errors with your Loop, an Issue Report can be used to help identify where the problem is occurring. The Issue Report is automatically generated and you can share it via email. Frequently, if you seek help with a technical problem, an Issue Report will provide insight for the developers and troubleshooters. Please email yourself an Issue Report anytime you are questioning Loop actions or displays. You can then use that Issue Report later to help debug the problem.\n\n\n\n\nBefore you continue further, a word about BG units\n\n\nEntries into the configuration section will be available in mg/dL or mmol/L automatically, based upon how your blood glucose values are received. By default they are set to mg/dL, however once CGM values arrive in mmol/L these Loop settings can be entered in mmol/L. \nIf you are planning to use mmol/L, be sure to wait to set your entries until after you have started to receive CGM values in Loop.\n If you do these in the wrong order, then your charts and entries may have incorrect units.\n\n\n\n\nCorrection Range\n\u2301\n\n\nThe correction range is your blood glucose range that you would like Loop to correct to. Correction range is not necessarily the same target blood glucose range that you have discussed with your endocrinologist; generally the doctor's range may be much wider. For example, you may keep a correction target of 100-110 for Loop to aim to, but use a desired BG target range of 80-180 when discussing things with your endo about \"time in range\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the + in the upper right corner to add correction BG range(s). You can have multiple ranges based on time of day, but the first setting of the day needs to begin at midnight.\n\n\nCorrection ranges can be a single number, such as 100-100 mg/dL.  Generally, you don't want to keep correction ranges too wide otherwise Loop will be sluggish to correct. Most users keep correction range no wider than about 0 to 30 mg/dL between the minimum and maximum values.\n\n\nOverride Ranges\n\u2301\n\n\nBelow the Correction Range entry is a section called \"Overrides\". Override ranges provide temporary alternate correction ranges. These override ranges will only be enacted when you specifically activate pre-meal or workout mode using the buttons on the main Loop display or watchface. While active, they replace the correction range for Loop's recommendations. If the override ranges are not entered in this section, the buttons will remain grey and unusable on the main screen's toolbar.\n\n\nPre-Meal:\n\nThe pre-meal override target can be used to as an easy way to get a small amount of insulin delivered before a meal in order to help control post-meal blood glucose spikes.\n\n\nIf your normal target is 100-100 mg/dL and pre-meal target is 80-80 mg/dL, for example, Loop will give you an extra push to get you to the lower target number before the meal. This early insulin brings you into the meal with a mini-prebolus. The pre-meal target, when activated by pressing on the icon, will stay active for one hour, until carbs are entered, or until it is manually cancelled...whichever comes first.\n\n\nLoop will adjust any insulin bolus as needed based on the extra insulin provided during this pre-meal time.\n\n\nWorkout Mode:\n\nWorkout override target is designed to temporarily set your target higher in anticipation of exercise or other activities which tend to make the user more insulin sensitive or need less insulin. By setting a higher temp target ahead of activity, Loop will recommend less basal rate(s) than normally scheduled in order to to bring blood glucose up to the higher target.\n\n\nThe success of this strategy will be dependent on how far in advance of activity the override target is set. Generally, users set the target approximately 1-2 hours in advance of planned activities, but the optimal timing will depend on the activity, duration, and intensity. Additionally, any insulin on board from recent boluses may overwhelm the Loop's ability to counteract exercise-induced lows through lower temp basals alone. Please see LoopTips.org for additional information about \nexercise and Loop\n.\n\n\nSuspend Threshold\n\u2301\n\n\nThe suspend threshold must be set up for successful configuration of Loop. \nYour Loop will not turn green without setting this value.\n This value affects both bolus and basal recommendations by Loop.\n\n\nBolus\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nIf you are trying to bolus a meal while any part of the predicted BG curve is below this suspend threshold value, Loop will not recommend a bolus.  Instead, you will need to wait until your prediction curve is above the suspend threshold value in order to bolus.\n\n\n\n\nBasal\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nIf your current or any point on your predicted BG curve is below the suspend threshold, Loop will always recommend a temporary basal rate of 0 U/hr.\n\n\n\n\nReasonable settings for suspend threshold will depend on user preference, but recommended not set lower than 65 mg/dL.\n\n\nBasal Rates\n\u2301\n\n\nYour basal rates have already been initially populated when you finished the \nAdd Pump\n part of the setup previously.  Only one basal schedule may be set in each Loop app. The basal increments are available according to the increments of the particular pump/pod you are using. Not all pumps provide the same increments for basal deliveries. Basal schedule must start at midnight and cannot contain rates of 0 U/hr.\n\n\nIf you need to edit your basal schedule, simply make the edits as needed and then click on \nSave to Pump...\n or \nSync With Pod\n button, depending on which pump you are using. \n\n\n\n\nIf you make any basal edits and use the \nCancel\n button to go back to the menu without successfully saving/snycing to pump/pod, the changes you made will not be saved. Loop makes saving/syncing to pump a mandatory step to successfully editing basal rates. If you get an error message while trying to save/sync the edited basal rates, please retry until successful.\n\n\n\n\nDelivery Limits\n\u2301\n\n\nThe maximum basal rate and maximum bolus settings are collectively refered to as Delivery Limits. This section will have been initially populated when you finished the \nAdd Pump\n part of the setup previously. For safety, similar to basal schedule, you must keep these values the same on both the Loop app and within the pump/pod settings. If you edit these settings in Loop app, always use the \nSave to Pump...\n or \nSync With Pod\n button, depending on which pump you are using.\n\n\nMaximum Basal Rate\n\u2301\n\n\nMaximum basal rate will cap the the maximum temporary basal rate that the Loop is allowed to enact to meet your correction range. Typically, Loop users set their maximum basal rate around 3-4 times their highest scheduled basal rate. When you are first beginning to use Loop, it is wise to start conservative (low) in setting your maximum basal rate. If your settings are incorrect in other areas (basal rates, insulin sensitivity, carb ratio, etc), you may need time to identify where settings need to be adjusted. This process is easier if Loop is given less latitude to set high basal rates. Gradually increase your maximum basal rate as your comfort and confidence in Loop increases. If you need help with your settings adjustment, head over to LoopTips for some \ninitial settings help\n\n\nMaximum Bolus\n\u2301\n\n\nEnter your desired single bolus maximum here. For safety, don't set a maximum bolus limit any higher than your typical large meal bolus.\n\n\nInsulin Model\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are four insulin models to choose from; Walsh, Rapid-Acting Adults, Rapid-Acting Children, and Fiasp. If you want to read the nitty-gritty discussion that went into the development of the Rapid-Acting and Fiasp curves (collectively called \"exponential insulin models\"), you can see that in GitHub \nhere\n.\n\n\nWe highly recommend selecting one of the exponential insulin models (in other words, not the Walsh model).\n \n\n\nA common new Loop user error is to select Walsh model in order to easily shorten their insulin duration (DIA) to one like they used prior to Looping. This almost invariably leads to insulin stacking. If you would like to read more about why the duration of insulin action is important in Loop vs how you've traditionally used it, please click \nhere\n to read a blog post about the subject. In summary, choosing Walsh curve just to shorten your DIA will lead to insulin stacking and less than desired bolusing recommendations.\n\n\nYou can click on each model and see what each model's insulin activity curve looks like, active one selected in blue. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe differences between the three exponential models (two Rapid-Acting and Fiasp) models has to do with the timing of the peak insulin activity timing. Not surprising, since Fiasp is marketed as the \"faster acting\" insulin. Currently all the exponential models are defaulted to an insulin duration of 6 hours, but the peak activity of the curves differs:\n\n\n\n\nRapid-acting adult curve peaks at 75 minutes\n\n\nRapid-acting child curve peaks at 65 minutes\n\n\nFiasp peaks curve peaks at 55 minutes\n\n\n\n\nCarb Ratios\n\u2301\n\n\nClick the + in the upper right to add carb ratios for various times of day. Loop works best if you have \ntested and optimized\n your carb ratio settings for accuracy.\n\n\n\n\nBeware of other apps writing carbs to Health app\n\n\nIf you are using a third-party app (such as Spike or MyFitness) that can write carbohydrates to the phone's Health app, you will need to edit the permissions to make sure Loop doesn't double carb entries.  You should disable the third-party app's permissions in Health so that they can only \nread\n and not \nwrite\n.  See \nCarb Entries with Third Party apps\n for more information about this setting.\n\n\n\n\nInsulin Sensitivities\n\u2301\n\n\nInsulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF) is the same term as Correction Factor used in some clinics and endocrinology offices. ISF represents the drop in blood glucose levels expected from one unit of insulin. Click the + in the upper right to add insulin sensitivities for various times of day. Loop works best if you have \ntested and optimized\n your ISF settings for accuracy. Insulin sensitivities can change for many reasons including waiting too long to change your infusion set. Loop will not auto-detect changes in ISF.\n\n\nIncorrectly set ISF is the most common cause of roller coaster BGs for new Loop users. You will need to raise (increase) your ISF value/number to help smooth a roller coaster BG trend. You can read about that topic more over in LoopTips \nhere\n. \n\n\nNext Step: Loop Services\n\u2301\n\n\nYou have completed the required configurations and settings in your Loop app. If you have a Nightscout site you'd like to connect Loop to, please continue on to the \nLoop Services page\n. \n\n\nIf you are not integrating with a Nightscout site and don't want any optional logging services connected, then please proceed to the \nLoop's displays page\n. Understanding the Loop displays can be a valuable tool to understanding your Loop's actions, and also for troubleshooting, if you are having issues.",

Currently all the exponential models are defaulted to an insulin duration of 6 hours, but the peak activity of the curves differs:   Rapid-acting adult curve peaks at 75 minutes  Rapid-acting child curve peaks at 65 minutes  Fiasp peaks curve peaks at 55 minutes",

            "text": "Loop Displays\n\u2301\n\n\nThis section of the docs will go over the Loop displays available and what information they offer.  Information about your Loop's actions (or inactions) can often be found simply by looking at the visuals presented in the app.  \n\n\nStatus Screen\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Status Screen is the main root navigation screen in Loop. It is broken up into 3 main display areas; Heads Up display (HUD), Charts, and Toolbar. The HUD is the top area of the screen. This shows status of the last time loop ran, current BG Reading, current temp basal, and current pump information. The next area is the charting area. This includes, glucose trend and prediction, Active Insulin, Insulin Delivery, and Carbohydrates. The final display area is the toolbar which has buttons for Carbs, Pre-Meal, Bolus, Workout Mode, and Settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeads Up Display\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Heads Up Display (HUD) is a very useful quick reference guide to your Loop's status. Every 5 minutes, Loop updates CGM and pump/pod data. Loop timestamps the HUD data with when the last data point came in. If a timestamp goes older than 5 minutes old, that is a valuable indicator to where your Loop is failing to get needed information. The HUD's first three icons, from left to right, are the same no matter whether you are using a Medtronic pump or Omnipod; status of the last time loop ran, current BG Reading, and current temp basal. The last two icons will change depending on what type of pump you are using.\n\n\nMedtronic users: The last two icons are the most recent (1) pump/reservoir status and (2) pump percentage battery remaining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmnipod users: The last two icons are the most recent (1) pod/reservoir status and (2) hours of pod use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop Status\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Loop Status is the colored circle in the upper left corner of the main Loop display.  There are four colors that are typically displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA grey circle indicates the Loop is warming up and hasn\u2019t yet completed its initial loop.  When the Loop is first activated, it may take about 15-20 minutes to complete the first Loop, and the grey circle will be displayed.  It needs CGM data to be gathered, so be patient.  When it finally completes its first loop, the circle will turn green.  If you can't get your grey loop to turn green, please see the \nGrey Loop troubleshooting page\n for tips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA green circle indicates the Loop has been successfully completed within the last 5 minutes.  The time since the loop last completed will be displayed under the circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA yellow circle indicates the Loop has not completed in the last 5-15 minutes.  It is not unusual to have a few instances of yellow circles throughout a day of looping.  They can be caused by temporarily getting too far away from RileyLink or iPhone (more than about 3-10 feet depending on conditions), CGM failing to read or being in ???, radio frequency \u201cnoise\u201d interference, and such.  Generally, most yellow circles will self-resolve without needing any special troubleshooting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA red circle indicates the Loop has not completed in over 15 minutes.  This is not a typical state, and you should troubleshoot why Loop is not completing.  Please review the \nYellow and Red Loop troubleshooting page\n for tips on how to get your green Loop back.  Clicking on the red circle will also pop-up the last error message to help guide your troubleshooting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the circle is notched and not complete, that means the Loop is operating in \u201copen loop\u201d mode.  When the \u201cclosed loop\u201d setting is turned on, the loop status will show a completed circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe loop status circle will pulse slightly when RileyLink is giving the pump a new temp basal setting.  The pulsing will stop when the temp basal has been set by the pump.\n\n\nGlucose\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current BG reading from the CGM will display, including trending arrow and time the reading was taken.  If the BG is being read straight from the G5 transmitter or G4 receiver, no special symbols will appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the BG is being read from the Dexcom Share Servers, a small cloud icon will be in the corner of the BG reading.  Internet access is required to run in this mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you first start Loop, there may be a small yellow alert next to the BG.  This should go away within a short period of time (around 5 minutes or less).  If the yellow alert remains, something may be wrong with fetching BG data.  You can try restarting the Loop app (double tap home button, upswipe on app to close) to see if BG data will resume.  \nSpecial note for Dexcom G5 users\n, a yellow alert will appear when a calibration is needed.  The alert will clear once the calibration is given, but typically Loop will work IF the yellow alert is only for a needed G5 calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemp Basal\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe temp basal will display the enacted temp basal change relative to the scheduled basal.  So if the scheduled basal was 1.0 units per hour and Loop has set a temp basal of 0.2 units per hour, the temp basal icon will display -0.8 U, as shown in graphic to the left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReservoir (Medtronic Users)\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reservoir icon will remain grey and plain until insulin volume decreases.  At 25% reservoir volume remaining, the reservoir icon will turn yellow.  At 10% reservoir volume remaining, the reservoir icon will turn red.  The remaining units will be displayed when it gets to these lower thresholds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery (Medtronic Users)\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor x23, x54 pumps, the battery icon will show 100/75/50/25% increments just as the pump does.  As the battery level decreases, the icon will turn from grey to yellow to red.  For x22 pumps, the battery icon will read discrete % values.  \nThe warning colors/levels on Loop's battery indicator work in conjunction with the type of battery selected.  If you change battery types, please make sure to update your battery selection in the Loop app settings.   \nThe pump's on-screen battery indicator is not a good indicator of remaining battery life for the purposes of looping.  Loop's pump communications will fail from low battery levels sooner than the insulin delivery will fail.  The Loop's battery level warnings are designed to give you approximately 8 hours of notice before the pump battery will need changing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReservoir (Omnipod Users)\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pod icon will remain grey and plain until insulin volume decreases.  At 50 units or less insulin remaining, the reservoir icon will turn yellow. At 20 units or less remaining, the reservoir icon will turn red.  The remaining units will be displayed when it gets to these lower thresholds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPod Age (Omnipod Users)\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pod's age typical 3-day lifespan is represented by three equal segments of the pod age icon. As the pod ages, the segments are converted to a darker grey color. At 54 hours old, the pod age icon will turn yellow. At 72 hours old, the pod age icon will turn red. When you reach 80 hours of pod use, the pod will alarm and the pod age icon will show a \"replace pod\" message in the HUD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharts\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are several charts that help you navigate your Loop actions.  Clicking on each of the charts will also open up additional information.\n\n\nGlucose Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe glucose chart displays BG values in your preferred units. The vertical scale of the chart is calculated on the fly by Loop to be as useful as possible while including the highest and lowest readings in the chart.\n\n\nThe horizontal axis is set to go forward from the current time until your DIA forward (so you can see what Loop eventually thinks BG will be). It then goes back in time as far as it can based upon the width in pixels of your screen. Note, if you turn your device to landscape mode you will have more screen real estate and thus will be able to see further back in time.\n\n\nThe BG correction range is shown as a blue bar on the glucose chart.  Single-value target BG range (such as 100-100 mg/dl), will have a narrower blue range.  When a temporary override range is enabled, a darker blue bar where the overrides are set will be displayed, as well as the normal correction target in lighter blue.\n\n\nThe eventual BG displayed in the right side of the chart does NOT take into account a recently enacted temp basal.  In other words, if you are above BG target and Loop just enacted a high temp basal to help, the eventual BG does not reflect the expected lowering of BGs that would result from that recently enacted temp basal.  Loop waits until the insulin has actually been delivery before it \"uses\" the insulin in its calculations for BG impacts.  If you suspended your pump or had a \"no delivery\" alarm shortly after the temp basal was started, you would want that accurately reflected in the insulin on board and associated eventual BG.\n\n\nIf you tap on the Glucose Chart itself, it will open the Predicted Glucose chart described below.\n\n\nPredicted Glucose Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe predicted glucose view is a great way to gain insight into the various components\u2019 importance in Loop\u2019s prediction of eventual BG. The graph at the top of this view will match your Glucose Chart. Below this chart you will see a very detailed explanation of all of the variables that Loop takes into account in predicting your future BG value. Each of those effects (including Carbohydrates, Insulin, Glucose Momentum and Retrospective Correction) includes details of the calculation use. You can tap on any of the entries to turn them off and on for visualization. The resulting changes can be viewed by the changes in the dashed lines.\n\n\nAdditionally, at the bottom of this screen there is a setting to \nEnable Retrospective Correction\n. By enabling it, it will more aggressively increase or decrease basal delivery when BG movement doesn\u2019t match the carbohydrates and insulin-based model.  Most Loopers have found this setting to be quite useful and keep the slider on.\n\n\nActive Insulin Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Active Insulin chart displays the total insulin contribution from both temp basals and boluses.  Active IOB can be either positive and negative IOB.  Negative IOB results from the suspension of normally scheduled basals.  The active insulin displayed in the upper right corner of the chart does NOT include insulin contributions from a recently enacted temp basal or bolus until the pump\u2019s reservoir volume is read and confirms a drop in reservoir volume (confirming the insulin has actually been delivered).  So long as you have Event History as the Preferred Data Source in Loop settings, primed insulin deliveries (e.g., cannula fills or manual primes) will not be counted towards IOB.\n\n\nInsulin Delivery Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Insulin Delivery chart displays a history of the temp basals enacted by Loop.  The display is relative to the scheduled basal rates entered in the Loop settings.  So, a rate displayed in this chart as \n+0 units\n would indicate no temp basal was set, and Loop defaulted to the scheduled basal rate.  Individual boluses are indicated by an orange triangle on the chart (shown in the graphic above, near the left-most time).  The total insulin delivered since midnight, including all basals and boluses \nAND priming insulin\n, is given in the upper right corner of the graph.\n\n\nPlease be patient for a bolus delivery to appear.  There is a lag time from when you press the \u201cdeliver\u201d bolus button to when the orange triangle is drawn sometimes.  The insulin has to be delivered and then the pump reservoir needs to be read to confirm delivery, before the triangle will appear and IOB will be added.  Occassionally, the bolus may be temporarily rendered (drawn) as a very high temp basal rate vs. a (triangle) discrete bolus event.  This does NOT mean that the Loop actually enacted a high temp basal rate...only that the bolus is being \ndrawn\n on the chart in the equivalent of a high temp basal rate.\n\n\nReservoir and Event History\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClicking on either the Active Insulin or Insulin Delivery charts will open your Insulin Delivery history.  The top of the screen will display the current IOB and the total insulin delivered for the day since midnight (or since the time the loop became active if you started Loop after midnight). There are two viewing options; Reservoir or Event History.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReservoir: Omnipod users will not have a reservoir history displayed, simply because pods do not report or track insulin remaining until their reservoirs get below 50 units remaining. Medtronic users will have reservoir history displayed in 5 minute increments, unless Loop has been having communication issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent History: Event history is a detailed accounting of all pump/pod actions. Both Medtronic and Omnipod users will have a detailed record of event history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbohydrate Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Carbohydrate chart displays the carbs used by Loop to predict BG changes.  The active COB is displayed in the upper right corner of the chart.  Clicking on the chart will open the Carb Entries history and you can edit/delete any previous entries through that screen.  Please read the \nCarb Entries page\n for more information about editing carb entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about the Insulin Counteraction Effects information found in the Carb History, please see \nhere\n.\n\n\nTool Bar\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tool bar is where your inputs to the Loop behavior take place.  The individual components of the tool bar are, left to right:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarb entry tool\n- click on this tool to enter carbs into the Loop app.  Loop will not read carb entries from the pump or Nightscout, so you must use the carb entry tool in Loop app in order to have carbs accounted for by the Loop.  Detailed info regarding how to enter, save, and edit carb entries can be found in the \nCarb Entries page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-meal target\n - click this tool to set the \nPre-Meal temporary override target\n.  This target will remain in effect (1) for 60 minutes, (2) until a carb entry is saved, or (3) until target is toggled off manually, whichever comes first.  The background coloring of the Pre-Meal target will turn green when active and there will be a dark blue line on the BG chart indicating where the override target is enabled.  For more information about use of the Pre-Meal target, see the \nBolus Entries page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolus tool\n - click on this tool to bring up the bolus tool.  Normally, this screen will automatically open on it's own and function as a bolus wizard when a meal is saved on the carb entry tool screen.  The only time the bolus tool will not automatically open is if the amount of carbs saved is determined to be adequately covered by the insulin on board already.  During rapidly rising BGs, where Loop doesn't have an adequate temp basal rate to cover the pace at which BGs are rising, you may try clicking on the bolus tool to see if Loop is recommending a correction bolus to help control the BG spike.  For more information about the Bolus tool features and use, see the \nBolus Entries page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkout Target\n - click this tool to set the \nWorkout temporary override target\n.  This target will remain in effect for the duration you select.  The standard duration selections available are 1 hour, 2 hour, or indefinitely.  You can add or modify those options, before building the Loop app, by using the \nWorkout mode customization option\n.  For more information about using the Workout Mode, see \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop Settings\n - click on this tool to make changes to any of your \nLoop settings\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Step: RileyLink Menu\n\u2301\n\n\nYou are almost there!

From that pump screen, scroll to the bottom and you will see the names of your connected RileyLink(s). (Note: The device searching indicator near the RileyLink's toggle will always be spinning, even after a RileyLink is successfully connected. That is normal behavior.)\n\n\nHelpful tip: If you are ever going to be near other Loop users, you may want to consider renaming your RileyLink to a new name so that you can pick it out of a crowd.  Click on the RileyLink line, and the RileyLink's menu will be displayed. At the top of this menu is a line for the device name. Click on the that line and you will be able to change the name of your RileyLink. The new name may need to sit for a few seconds before exiting back out of the naming screen for it to save itself. RileyLink must be connected and on to change the name.\n\n\nDepending on which pump you have connected to your Loop app, your RL menu will look different. On the left below is the typical RL menu when using Medtronic pump, and on the right is with an Omnipod. As you can see, both have in common a section called \"Device\", but after that only the Medtronic pumps will have additional commands in the RileyLink menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevice\n\u2301\n\n\nThe settings under the Device section are mostly for your information only. The two most important lines are the Connection Status and Signal Strength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Connections Status should say \nconnected\n if the RileyLink is connected to the iPhone's Bluetooth. If the status says \nconnecting\n or \ndisconnected\n then you should toggle the iPhone's BT and/or RileyLink's power switch off/on to help reconnect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Signal Strength is the strength of the Bluetooth signal between the iPhone and RileyLink.  It is \nnot\n the signal strength of the radio communications with the pump/pod.  The lower the number, the stronger the connection. As you move the RL and iPhone closer/farther apart, you will be able to see the signal strength change. In a pinch, this can be used to help locate a lost RileyLink in the house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPump\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Pump ID and Pump Model will be automatically filled in from your pump. \n\n\nCommands\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are several commands that the RileyLink can issue to a Medtronic pump. Most are simply for gathering information from the pump.\n\n\nTune Radio Frequency\n\u2301\n\n\nThe pump and RileyLink communicate via radio frequency. In order to have the best possible communications, RileyLink will test a range of frequencies in order to see which provides the strongest response with the pump. In the event that pump comms fail for over 14 minutes, Loop will automatically retune the RileyLink to see if perhaps the strongest frequency has changed since it was last tuned.\n\n\nWhen you first setup your Loop app, RileyLink will automatically perform a \nTune Radio Frequency\n to get pump comms started. You can manually tune your radio frequency at any time by clicking on the command. It may take about a minute, but soon you will see a list of frequencies with the tuning strength results beside each frequency. The signal with the lowest value is the strongest and RileyLink will use that frequency. Exit out of that screen and the command line will now show the frequency (916.xx MHz for North American pumps) and the timestamp of the tune.\n\n\n\n\nA common troubleshooting recommendation is to tune your RL when you have poor pump communications. Just keep in mind that the Loop code has a function that it will automatically retune in the event of poor pump communications within 14 minutes. Loop does this automatically.  Manually retuning is only useful for impatience purposes. If Loop has failed longer than 20 minutes, it will have already likely tried a retune...but knock yourself out if you want to try it again manually.\n\n\n\n\nChange Time\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop automatically prompts you to set your pump time using the Loop app as part of initial Loop setup.  It is important that Loop and your pump share a common time setting, otherwise Looping will fail.  If you are traveling through timezones or dealing with daylight savings time, please read up on \nhow to safely change your pump time\n.\n\n\n\n\nAlways use the RileyLink's \nChange Time\n command to change pump time.  If you fail to set the pump time by using the RileyLink, Loop will not function properly.  Do not use the pump menus to change your pump's time when Looping.\n\n\n\n\nOther commands\n\u2301\n\n\nMySentry Pair, Fetch Recent History, Fetch Enlite Glucose, Get Pump Model, Send Button Press, Read Pump Status, and Read Basal Schedule are all ways of asking the pump for information you might be interested in. They are not part of setting up the Loop and will not affect Loop operations. Enable Diagnostic LEDs, Discover Commands, and RileyLink Statistics are commands that are sometimes used by developers to aid in app troubleshooting and debugging. They don't impact Loop operations.\n\n\nMySentry Pair\n is for x23 and x54 pumps only, and you will have completed this pairing command as part of the original \nAdd Pump\n process. The MySentry pairing process adds a specific ID to your pump in the pump's Connect Devices, Other Devices menu. This pairing allows Loop to get information from x23 and x54 in an efficient manner. If that is not done, Loop will only be green every other loop. If you ever want to re-pair MySentry, you can follow the directions as shown in the RileyLink command screen. You do not have to worry about this command if you are using an x15 or x22 model pump, as they do not have MySentry.\n\n\nFetch Recent History\n polls the pump for recent pump events such as boluses, temp basals, primes, rewinds, etc.  The amount of information transmitted for a Fetch Recent History is usually quite large and, as a result, may be more prone to an early failure before it succeeds. If the first Fetch Recent History fails, sometimes it is helpful to use the Send Button Press command to sort of \"wake up\" the pump in preparation for communications.\n\n\nFetch Enlite Glucose\n is only useful for Medtronic CGM users. The Fetch Enlite Glucose command will pull the recent glucose values saved in the pump history. Dexcom users do not store any glucose data in the pump.\n\n\nGet Pump Model\n simply returns the pump's model.\n\n\nSend Button Press\n can be useful to see if the communication between the RileyLink and pump is working. If successful, the screen on the pump will light up and Loop will confirm the button press with a \nsuccess\n message. If pump comms are failing, sending a successful button press can help \"wake up\" a pump that perhaps has not been communicating well.\n\n\nRead Pump Status\n is also nice quick pump read for reservoir volume, pump battery voltage, and pump status (bolusing or suspending). For x23 and x54 pump users, this command will provide the exact pump battery voltage instead of the 25/50/75/100% levels that are reported otherwise.\n\n\nRead Basal Schedule\n will pull the active basal pattern from the pump so you can review what the current settings are without using pump menu.\n\n\nEnable Diagnostic LEDs\n will turn on more LED flashes on the RileyLink while it is operating. You will see more blue flashing lights as the RileyLink communicates with the pump. If you tried turning on this feature and decide later that you just don't want to see so many flashing lights, simply reboot the RileyLink by turning the power switch off/on.  This will reset the LEDs.\n\n\nDiscover Commands\n just ignore this menu item.\n\n\nRileyLink Statistics\n tracks how long your RileyLink has stayed successfully operating and gives the developers some useful information about the stability of the RL operations. It really doesn't provide much to the average Loop user, however.",

Fetch Recent History  polls the pump for recent pump events such as boluses, temp basals, primes, rewinds, etc.  The amount of information transmitted for a Fetch Recent History is usually quite large and, as a result, may be more prone to an early failure before it succeeds. If the first Fetch Recent History fails, sometimes it is helpful to use the Send Button Press command to sort of \"wake up\" the pump in preparation for communications.  Fetch Enlite Glucose  is only useful for Medtronic CGM users. The Fetch Enlite Glucose command will pull the recent glucose values saved in the pump history. Dexcom users do not store any glucose data in the pump.  Get Pump Model  simply returns the pump's model.  Send Button Press  can be useful to see if the communication between the RileyLink and pump is working. If successful, the screen on the pump will light up and Loop will confirm the button press with a  success  message. If pump comms are failing, sending a successful button press can help \"wake up\" a pump that perhaps has not been communicating well.  Read Pump Status  is also nice quick pump read for reservoir volume, pump battery voltage, and pump status (bolusing or suspending). For x23 and x54 pump users, this command will provide the exact pump battery voltage instead of the 25/50/75/100% levels that are reported otherwise.  Read Basal Schedule  will pull the active basal pattern from the pump so you can review what the current settings are without using pump menu.  Enable Diagnostic LEDs  will turn on more LED flashes on the RileyLink while it is operating. You will see more blue flashing lights as the RileyLink communicates with the pump. If you tried turning on this feature and decide later that you just don't want to see so many flashing lights, simply reboot the RileyLink by turning the power switch off/on.  This will reset the LEDs.  Discover Commands  just ignore this menu item.  RileyLink Statistics  tracks how long your RileyLink has stayed successfully operating and gives the developers some useful information about the stability of the RL operations. It really doesn't provide much to the average Loop user, however.",

After a carb entry is saved, Loop will provide a bolus screen with a recommended bolus amount. The only time the bolus screen wouldn't appear is if Loop believes the insulin-on-board is already sufficient to cover the added carbs or you are missing current blood glucose data. If you want to deliver the total amount of the recommended bolus, simply tap on the recommended amount of units and the bolus delivery line will automatically be filled-in with the same units. If you want to give fewer units than the recommended amount, you can manually enter the desired amount to be delivered.\n\n\nThe bolus tool will not offer a recommended bolus if your BG is predicted to go below your specified suspend threshold. A screen will appear letting you know the reason no bolus is being recommended, as well as the status of your active COB and IOB.

Correction boluses will not be delivered automatically by Loop, they must be delivered by the user. Loop will also not give an alert when a correction bolus is being offered, the bolus entry tool must be clicked to check for one. The Loop pill in Nightscout will display when Loop has a recommended bolus calculated. In a well-tuned Loop with decent carb counting, correction boluses should be infrequently needed.\n\n\nStarting Bolus Notification\n\u2301\n\n\nA new status line will appear when Loop is sending a bolus command to the pump. Just above the main screen's glucose chart, you will see a \"starting bolus\" indicator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolus Failure Notifications\n\u2301\n\n\nOn occasion, you will receive notification that a bolus may have failed. In some of these cases, the bolus actually will begin delivery. Therefore, you should always check the pump screen to verify the bolus status before attempting to redeliver a failed bolus.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a known issue with some x15 WW pumps falsely stating bolus failure notifications with every bolus.  Please read \nhere\n for additional information about how to fix the issue until Loop code is updated with a permanent fix.\n\n\n\n\nPre-Meal\n\u2301\n\n\nThe pre-meal override target can be used prior to bolusing in order to help control post-prandial BGs. Most users will set a lower pre-meal target than what their normal correction range is. For example, a pre-meal target might be 80 - 80 mg/dL while your normal correction range might be 100-110 mg/dL. If you engage the pre-meal targets up to an hour before the meal, Loop will deliver an \"extra\" amount of insulin while it aims for that lower BG target. By getting the insulin in a little sooner, there will be more active insulin awaiting the carb absoprtion when the meal is eaten.\n\n\nThe pre-meal target will remain active until (1) 60 minutes has passed since it was activated, or (2) a carbohydrate entry has been saved in Loop, or (3) the Loop user manually cancels the pre-meal target by tapping on the icon again. Whichever of these happens first will cancel the pre-meal targets. If no action is taken, the pre-meal target will end on its own after 60 minutes.\n\n\nIf you are using the pre-meal target and save the carbs for the meal entry, Loop will cancel the pre-meal target and revert back to your normal correction range. Loop will account for the insulin it has \"prebolused\" while trying to reach the lower pre-meal target, and use your normal correction range when making the bolus recommendation.\n\n\nSquare or Dual Waves\n\u2301\n\n\nUnfortunately, Loop cannot enact temp basals while the pump is delivering a square- or dual-wave bolus. Therefore, you will need to use alternate bolusing strategies for situation where you would've previously used those extended bolusing techniques.\n\n\nThe good news is that Loop has the only \"smart\" bolus tool available in any DIY or commercial loop. Because you are entering a carb absorption time with each carb entry, Loop is also using that information to predict how well your insulin bolusing and carb absorption will align. So when Loop offers you a bolus, it may actually offer less of a bolus upfront for long, slow carb meals...and will make up the remaining bolus amount via high temp basals later.\n\n\nIn understanding Loop's smart bolusing, it may help to think back to the reason you originally used square- or dual-wave boluses. Typically, you used those extended bolusing strategies because if you had entered all the insulin, based on carb ratio alone, upfront at the beginning of the meal...you would have gone low shortly after bolusing. The food would simply be absorbing too slow and the whole amount of insulin working too fast...and you'd go low until the rest of the meal would kick in later. The extended bolusing was a way of avoiding the early low and also addressing the later high for meals like pizza or chinese food.\n\n\nLoop emmulates that extended bolusing when you enter long duration carb absorptions. Let's use an example of a pizza meal where carb ratios alone would've required a 10 unit bolus for the meal.  By telling Loop the meal will take a long (aka 4+ hours) carb absorption time, Loop may only offer 6 units up front as an initial bolus. After you eat though, Loop knows that it has not provided all the insulin that will be necessary to account for the carbs. Loop will provide the remaining 4 units via high temp basals as soon as predicted BGs are showing that there is no danger of a post-prandial low. In other words, Loop waits until the danger of a quick low is over and then will high temp to cover the late digesting carbs. If you don't want to wait for Loop to deliver the remaining \"second\" bolus via high temps, you can click on the bolus tool when BGs start to rise and deliver the remaining bolus needed. Loop will have a recommended bolus awaiting when the predicted BGs are above correction range.\n\n\nYou can read another example of this extended bolusing technique over on \nLoopTips.org\n.\n\n\nWhile you adapt to new bolusing techniques, it is important to monitor closely to see what works for you. It will take some trial and error to get it right. For meals like Chinese food, where there is a mix of fast carbs and slow carbs, you may want to break the total meal entry into a couple mixed carb entries to help Loop provide the best bolus recommendation upfront. Additionally, some people account for the fats/proteins that digest by adding slow carbs with long absorption times for meals that cause late BG rises.\n\n\nA very useful tool is to check back on your Insulin Counteraction Effects graph to see how your original entry compared to how Loop perceived your final meal impacts. You can read more about that tool \nhere\n.\n\n\nGlucodyn\n\u2301\n\n\nUsing the \nGlucodyn\n model can help you simulate new bolusing strategies.  Glucodyn allows you to simulate your post-prandial BGs based on your particular ISF, carb ratio, and carbs. You can simulate split boluses and watch their impact on simulated BG responses.  The underlying math of the Glucodyn model was the basis of Loop's insulin/carb calculations in early Loop versions. The math has changed since then, however the model still provides a useful visualization about the interactions between DIA, carb absorption times and insulin dosing.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, Loop cannot enact temp basals while the pump is delivering a square- or dual-wave bolus. Therefore, you will need to use alternate bolusing strategies for situation where you would've previously used those extended bolusing techniques.  The good news is that Loop has the only \"smart\" bolus tool available in any DIY or commercial loop. Because you are entering a carb absorption time with each carb entry, Loop is also using that information to predict how well your insulin bolusing and carb absorption will align. So when Loop offers you a bolus, it may actually offer less of a bolus upfront for long, slow carb meals...and will make up the remaining bolus amount via high temp basals later.  In understanding Loop's smart bolusing, it may help to think back to the reason you originally used square- or dual-wave boluses. Typically, you used those extended bolusing strategies because if you had entered all the insulin, based on carb ratio alone, upfront at the beginning of the meal...you would have gone low shortly after bolusing. The food would simply be absorbing too slow and the whole amount of insulin working too fast...and you'd go low until the rest of the meal would kick in later. The extended bolusing was a way of avoiding the early low and also addressing the later high for meals like pizza or chinese food.  Loop emmulates that extended bolusing when you enter long duration carb absorptions. Let's use an example of a pizza meal where carb ratios alone would've required a 10 unit bolus for the meal.  By telling Loop the meal will take a long (aka 4+ hours) carb absorption time, Loop may only offer 6 units up front as an initial bolus. After you eat though, Loop knows that it has not provided all the insulin that will be necessary to account for the carbs. Loop will provide the remaining 4 units via high temp basals as soon as predicted BGs are showing that there is no danger of a post-prandial low. In other words, Loop waits until the danger of a quick low is over and then will high temp to cover the late digesting carbs. If you don't want to wait for Loop to deliver the remaining \"second\" bolus via high temps, you can click on the bolus tool when BGs start to rise and deliver the remaining bolus needed. Loop will have a recommended bolus awaiting when the predicted BGs are above correction range.  You can read another example of this extended bolusing technique over on  LoopTips.org .  While you adapt to new bolusing techniques, it is important to monitor closely to see what works for you. It will take some trial and error to get it right. For meals like Chinese food, where there is a mix of fast carbs and slow carbs, you may want to break the total meal entry into a couple mixed carb entries to help Loop provide the best bolus recommendation upfront. Additionally, some people account for the fats/proteins that digest by adding slow carbs with long absorption times for meals that cause late BG rises.  A very useful tool is to check back on your Insulin Counteraction Effects graph to see how your original entry compared to how Loop perceived your final meal impacts.

As I entered the food in originally, I was still trying to come up with a good guess on the ratio of fast:slow carbs but kid was in a hurry to eat.  My initial guess around 3:30pm was 70g of carbs at 5 hours absorption (note: it gets edited to 80g in a little bit), we bolused for that and she started to eat.  About 10 minutes later, I decided to add 10g of fast acting carbs at 1 hour absorption to help with the sauce's speedy carbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatching what was going on a little later...BGs were rising at a decent clip and I had a feeling I really didn't cover things super well...so I edited the original 70g entry, adding 10g and making it 80g instead.  (That's why there is a 2U bolus around 4:20pm.)  And of course around 5:40pm there was a little bit of nibbling on the leftovers as we put them into the fridge.  We gave 10g for that.  BGs climbed a bit more, not suprising given how we were underestimating fast carbs at this point...but still not so bad at 180 peak BG.  (Anna gave 2 units correction at the peak because there was dessert coming later that night and she wanted to be ready for it without too much prebolus.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, how can I use the ICE info to make this meal better?  I can look at the observed ICE information and the observed carb entry Loop has recorded to adjust my insulin bolusing the next time we eat this meal.\n\n\nFor example, the biggest weakness I had in this (and suspected it even as I did the initial bolus) was that I underestimated the sauce's fast carbs.  I can see this in the observed ICE graph having the early green peaks after the meal, and in the way that the observed carb distribution was more like 7:2 vs my original guess of 8:1 (slow:fast carbs).  Overall looks like I guess on overall carb content pretty close (90g vs. 89g observed).

            "text": "Pump Battery\n\u2301\n\n\nOne common confusion point for new Loop users is how to interpret their pump's battery levels and whether they need to change their pump batteries based on which pieces of information.\n\n\nDischarge Curves\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are generally two different types of AAA batteries that we use in these Medtronic pumps; alkaline or lithium.\n\n\nTo understand pump battery levels, you first need to know a little about \nbattery discharge curves\n.  It's not a hard concept...basically how a battery dies over time as it is used or sits in a drawer.  More technically said, a battery discharge curve is the measure of volts that a battery puts out over time.  Batteries start at a higher voltage output and slowly that volatge output degrades over time (or use) until the battery no longer provides enough \"ummph\" to keep the electronic gadget going.  BUT, alkaline batteries and lithium batteries have different discharge curves due to the chemistry inside them, and the curves can be slightly different depending on environment (temperature) and battery manufacturer.\n\n\nAlkaline batteries have a relatively steady voltage drop over time, as shown below.  Notice the shape of the curve has a significant amount of time in the 1.3 to 1.2 volts range, and a relatively smooth decline to about 1.2 volts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLithium batteries have a much steadier voltage output over time, as shown below.  Notice how the shape of the curve is relatively flat for a large portion of the battery life before suddenly off around 1.3 volts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the above information mean in terms of Looping?  A lithium battery at 1.3v is going to have a much quicker time to death than an alkaline battery sitting at 1.3v.  You might only get a couple hours of looping left when a lithium battery is at 1.3v, but a alkaline battery at 1.3v might go another several days.  So when we talk about setting alarm levels in either system, your battery type is an important consideration.\n\n\nMedtronic Pump Battery Level Indicator\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you read Medtronic's literature, it will tell you to use Energizer alkaline batteries in their pumps.  Why would that be?  Hint: the answer doesn't mean that Duracell batteries are inherently worse than Energizer or that lithium batteries won't work in Medtronic pumps.\n\n\nThe answer is all about the accuracy of their little pump battery level indicator on their pump's screen.\n  Medtronic calibrated their pump battery level indicator to:\n\n\n\n\nEnergizer alkaline batteries\n\n\nNormal (non-Loop) uses\n\n\nTemperatures between 37\u00b0F (3\u00b0C) to 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C).\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, Medtronic ran experiments to see exactly how long an Energizer alkaline battery will last in normal pump use and made their own discharge curve.  They programmed their pump battery level indicator to change from 4 bars to 3 bars to 2 bars to 1 bar based on that particular discharge curve.\n\n\nHowever, Loop users are slightly more demanding on the pump's battery/voltage than simply having the insulin delivery.  We are also asking for the pump to perform radio communications, in addition to delivering insulin.  That radio communications needs a slightly higher voltage than the typical \"normal\" pump use.  So while a non-Looper might be ok running their pump until a voltage of about 1.12 for insulin delivery, radio communications might stop at a voltage output of about 1.17.  If you experiment with your Looping pump, you'll find Loop will turn red from failed pump comms before the pump actually fails at insulin delivery.  This difference between \"failure\" voltages needs to be considered when determining how much useful battery life is left for a pump battery.\n\n\nIn summary, that little pump battery indicator on the Medtronic pump screen is ONLY useful if you are:\n\n\n\n\nnot using the pump for Looping,\n\n\nusing Energizer alkaline batteries, and\n\n\nin the temperature environment similar to their testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop users should not rely on their Medtronic pump screen's pump battery indicator, and instead use the Loop's pump battery level indicator.\n\n\n\n\nLoop's Pump Battery Level Indicator\n\u2301\n\n\nKeeping the information about battery discharge curves in mind, Loop developers tested various battery brands and types to develop discharge curves for Loop users.  These discharge curves form the basis of the pump battery level indicator found in the top right of the Loop's main display screen and the pump battery notifications provided by the Loop app.  The pump battery level indicator will also report in %.\n\n\n\n\nFor x23 and x54 model users, the Loop's pump battery level will move in 25% increments.\n\n\nFor x15 and x22 model users, the Loop's pump battery level will move in discrete % increments.\n\n\n\n\nUsing information of the battery type selected and the pump model being used, the Loop's pump battery level notifications are designed to give the user about 8 hours of notice before pump communications are likely to fail.  The Loop user should have some additional time after pump comms fail before actual insulin delivery would stop.\n\n\nNightscout Pump Battery Display\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Nightscout information regarding pump battery levels will depend on pump model being used.\n\n\n\n\nIf you use an x23 or x54 pump and MySentry, the pump levels are reported as \npercent\n to NS, because that's how MySentry reports the data to Loop.  The packets use 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% increments, and the Loop's main display matches the NS pump display.\n\n\nIf you use an x22 or x15 pump, the pump levels are reported as \nvoltage\n readings to NS because Loop has to specifically ask the pump for its voltage reading.  The Loop's main display will show pump battery level as discrete %, not the individual voltage measurement.\n\n\nNo matter what pump you are using, you can always get a the current pump battery's voltage by using the RileyLink's \nRead Pump Status\n command.\n\n\nThe extra communications effort for non-MySentry model pumps will mean slightly shorter battery life vs. MySentry model pumps.\n\n\n\n\nNightscout Pump Battery Alarms\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Nightscout alarms are based on the Heroku settings that you have input specifically.  If you don't specifically set them, Nightscout will use the default settings for pump battery alerts as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNightscout pump battery levels, if you leave things at default installation, will not trigger alarms.  If however you add an setting of \nPUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS\n to \ntrue\n, you will receive pump battery notifications according to the levels shown in the parenthesis above.  For example, your x23 pump is reporting its levels in percent, therefore you'd receive a warning yellow alarm at 30% and an urgent red alarm at 20%.  Your x22 pump however is reporting its levels at voltage readings, therefore you'd receive a warning yellow alarm at 1.35v and an urgent red alarm at 1.30v.\n\n\n\n\nAre the default NS alarm levels going to work for you?  The answer depends on what type of battery level you are using, what model pump you are using, and how much advance notification you want to receive before needing to change a pump battery.  There is a bit of personal preference and experimentation to finding what works for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor x22 or x15 pump users, the NS alert settings that may need to be adjusted are the ones based on voltage.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, for a x22 or x15 pump using alkaline batteries, the default NS alarm levels will be too early to be useful and lead you to changing out your battery too frequently.  Alkaline batteries can go to low 1.2s or high 1.1s before Looping starts to have communication problems.  How much lower than the default voltage 1.35/1.30 alarm levels you want to go will depend on how far in advance you want to be warned about an upcoming battery change.\n\n\nIf however, you are using a x22 or x15 pump with lithium batteries, the default 1.35v/1.30v alarm levels may be completely appropriate.  Remember how the lithium battery curves at the start of this discussion died off quickly around 1.3v?  You won't get hardly any heads-up notice for a lithium battery if you set the alarm below 1.3v.\n\n\n\n\nFor x23 or x54 pump users, the NS alert settings that may need to be adjusted are the ones based on percentage settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlkaline and lithium batteries should have automatically had their percentage-remaining based on the correct battery type in your Loop settings.  So, generally speaking the default NS alert levels don't generally need adjusting.  However, if you are using lithium batteries, the drop off between 75% to 25% can be quite dramatic and not be easy to anticipate (especially if the drop happens overnight).\n\n\nAs an alternate method of tracking pump battery changes, you could use the insulin age (IAGE) plug-in to anticipate your pump battery changes as well.  For example, after tracking pump battery life on my 723 using energizer batteries lithium batteries for the last several months, I know that we get about 15 days plus a handful of hours.  The amount of hours more beyond 15 days varies depending on how much we've interacted with the pump buttons directly, whether we've looped the full 15 days solid, and if the pump has been in extreme weather (cold weather can sap pump battery life).  By tracking the pump battery changes with NS's careportal \"insulin cartridge change\", I can see in advance if we are nearing an overnight on a 15 day battery and decide to change batteries before overnight to prevent any middle-of-night battery issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLithium batteries will get signifcantly longer life than an alkaline battery.\n\n\nExperiment and track your particular pump model and battery type to understand what NS settings will work best for you.\n\n\nDo not rely on the pump's on-screen pump battery indicator, especially when using lithium batteries.",

            "text": "There are generally two different types of AAA batteries that we use in these Medtronic pumps; alkaline or lithium.  To understand pump battery levels, you first need to know a little about  battery discharge curves .  It's not a hard concept...basically how a battery dies over time as it is used or sits in a drawer.  More technically said, a battery discharge curve is the measure of volts that a battery puts out over time.  Batteries start at a higher voltage output and slowly that volatge output degrades over time (or use) until the battery no longer provides enough \"ummph\" to keep the electronic gadget going.  BUT, alkaline batteries and lithium batteries have different discharge curves due to the chemistry inside them, and the curves can be slightly different depending on environment (temperature) and battery manufacturer.  Alkaline batteries have a relatively steady voltage drop over time, as shown below.  Notice the shape of the curve has a significant amount of time in the 1.3 to 1.2 volts range, and a relatively smooth decline to about 1.2 volts.     Lithium batteries have a much steadier voltage output over time, as shown below.  Notice how the shape of the curve is relatively flat for a large portion of the battery life before suddenly off around 1.3 volts.     What does the above information mean in terms of Looping?  A lithium battery at 1.3v is going to have a much quicker time to death than an alkaline battery sitting at 1.3v.  You might only get a couple hours of looping left when a lithium battery is at 1.3v, but a alkaline battery at 1.3v might go another several days.  So when we talk about setting alarm levels in either system, your battery type is an important consideration.",

When you are operating in open loop mode, Loop is offering recommedendations for temp basals and will display them on the main screen.  The recommendations will not be enacted unless you specifically choose to enact the temp basal.  Usually in open loop mode, you aren't really enacting the recommended basals but instead watching how the recommendations come in and figuring out WHY they are being recommended.\n\n\nIt is understandable to want to jump straight away into close loop mode, but a lot can be learned by watching Loop operate in open mode.  Becoming familiar with the algorithm can be easier by watching it in action rather than only reading about it in docs.\n\n\nTesting\n\u2301\n\n\nA great benefit of open loop mode is that you can establish a baseline of BG trends without the influence of temp basals from Loop.  This is particularly helpful if you haven't used Medtronic sites/pumps prior to Loop.  You may find that your basal rates change significantly coming from other brands of pumps.  Taking the time to establish a good Medtronic pump basal profile will set you up for a smoother transition to close loop mode.  Test your ISF during open loop time too, as ISF is an important component for every Loop calculation for temp basals.  Every 5 minutes, Loop uses your ISF...so it's worth testing it ahead of close loop mode.\n\n\nEventual BG\n\u2301\n\n\nOne of the best things you can do is to train yourself to watch the eventual BG rather than the current BG for helping understand Loop recommendations for temp basals.  So many of us have become accustomed to dealing with current BGs and perhaps IOB at the same time...but Loop is also looking at BG momentum, carbs on board, restrospective trends.  Loop is utilizing all of those variables to predict an eventual BG.  It's current decisions are based on that eventual BG.

Understand that the default carb absorption times in Loop may not work for your particular body.  Similar to how you perhaps had used extended boluses for meals that impacted BGs longer than the duration of your insulin...that same idea applies to estimating your carb absorption times.  Watch your meals and try to estimate how long they are impacting your BG for various types of food.  Watch the times when Loop would've wanted to suspend or high temp basal...ask yourself why it would be doing that.  Especially ask yourself if that is the same decision as you would've made at that time in a meal normally.  Would you be worried that you might go low later if you see Loop offering high temp basal early after a meal?  Would you be worried about going high later if Loop wants to suspend basals instead?  If you put some effort into this effort before closing the loop, it will pay off with a smoother transition to closed loop.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\u2301\n\n\nGet used to carrying the RileyLink around.  Find how far your connectivity stretches before you have pump communication problems.  Get used to troubleshooting yellow and red loops, finding out the pattern/cause of any potential loop issues.  You'll be less frustrated starting on closed loop if you aren't dealing with learning new electronics at the same time as you are learning carb absorption times in a closed loop.  Learn how to retune your RL. \n\n\nBolus\n\u2301\n\n\nBolus meals from the Loop, rather than the pump.  Become familiar with entering carbs into the Loop, as well as editing them.

There are several ways you can help make that transition as smooth as possible.  \n\n\nTiming\n\u2301\n\n\nMany people choose to transition to close loop in a step-wise fashion.  Starting close loop on weekends is an easier starting point so that you can minimize distractions (let's face it...you'll probably be staring at the Loop a lot for those first few days). Typically, people have an easier time transitioning to close loop for parts of their day that don't involve food...so nighttimes tend to be easier than daytimes to start.\n\n\nMaximum Basal Rate\n\u2301\n\n\nWhen you are first beginning to close loop, it is important to be conservative (low) in setting your maximum basal rate.  If your settings are incorrect in other areas (basal rates, carb absorption time, carb ratio, etc), Loop may enact incorrectly aggressive high temp basals.

            "text": "Blood Glucose Prediction\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop uses an algorithm to maintain blood glucose in a correction range by predicting the contributions from four individual effects (insulin, carbohydrates, retrospective correction, and blood glucose momentum) at any time \nt\n to recommend temporary basal rate corrections and boluses. \n\n\n\n\nYou can see the individual contributions of these effects by tapping on the predicted blood glucose chart on Loop's status screen. Loop updates this blood glucose prediction every five minutes when a new CGM value has been received and the pump's status has been updated.\n\n\nJust a note, this whole section is fairly technical. While perhaps not the most interesting topic for many readers, if you are seeking the detailed view of the Loop algorithm this discussion is quite useful. If you want a more surface understanding, the overview and temporary basal recommendations sections alone are probably sufficient.\n\n\nOverview\n\u2301\n\n\nBefore we delve into each of the four individual effects, a general overview figure may be a helpful start. There are four effects summed together to produce Loop's final predicted blood glucose curve. Each individual effect, along with their combined effect, are illustrated in the figure below. Insulin, from boluses and temporary basals, will have a decreasing effect on the prediction. Carbohydrates will have an increasing effect on the prediction. Blood glucose momentum effect can have a positive or negative effect, depending on how blood glucose is trending in the most recent CGM values. As shown in the example below, blood glucose is trending slightly upwards at the time of the prediction. Therefore, the blood glucose momentum effect\u2019s contribution is pulling up the overall prediction from the other three effects for a short time. Retrospective correction is having a decreasing effect on the prediction, indicating that the recent rise in blood glucose was not as large as had been previously predicted by Loop in the recent past. \n\n\n\n\nThe sections below provide detailed information on each of the four contributions. \n\n\nInsulin Effect\n\u2301\n\n\nMost traditional pump users and caregivers are already familiar with the concept of an insulin activity curve, where the insulin\u2019s effect is time dependent. Insulin takes a little while to affect blood glucose. The insulin effect typically peaks around one hour after giving insulin and then gradually decays. \n\n\n\n\nLoop provides users with two different classes of insulin models (i.e., an exponential model and the Walsh model). All of the exponential models have an insulin activity duration of 6 hours, whereas the insulin activity duration is customizable for the Walsh model. The rapid-acting and Fiasp insulin activity curves are modeled as exponential curves that match the shape of the insulin activity curves from insulin labeling, and as observed in both adults and children.\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of insulin effect remaining, or percent of remaining active insulin after an insulin bolus is delivered, is modeled mathematically in Loop with an exponential decay curve.\n\n\nInsulin Effect Remaining\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nIf a user\u2019s insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) is 50 mg/dL per 1 unit of insulin and the user gives 2 units of insulin, then the user\u2019s blood glucose would be expected to drop 100 mg/dL within the 6 hours following the insulin delivery. This insulin effect can be visualized in several different ways: the expected active insulin, expected drop in blood glucose every 5 minutes after delivery, and expected cumulative drop in blood glucose. The figures below use the Rapid Acting - Adult insulin model in Loop.\n\n\nActive Insulin\n\u2301\n\n\nThis figure shows that 2 units of insulin are given initially, and the corresponding active insulin (i.e., insulin on board IOB) decays according to the curve below. \n\n\n\n\nThe active insulin at any time is the product of original insulin delivered and the percent of insulin activity remaining. Knowing the expected active insulin over the next 6 hours, and the insulin sensitivity factor (50 mg/dL, in this case), Loop can calculate the expected drop in blood glucose from that dose of insulin as shown in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: ISF is also a function of time, which means if the user\u2019s scheduled ISF changes during the insulin activity time, it will change the expected drop in blood glucose due to the insulin effect. \n\n\nExpected Change in Blood Glucose\n\u2301\n\n\nLastly, taking the first derivative (i.e., the rate of change) of the cumulative drop in the blood glucose curve yields the expected change in blood glucose over the insulin activity duration. For each dose of insulin given, Loop calculates the expected discrete drop in blood glucose at each 5-minute period for the insulin activity duration, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\nInsulin Effect on Blood Glucose\n\u2301\n\n\nFor this example, assuming a user\u2019s blood glucose was 205 mg/dL at the time of insulin delivery, Loop would predict a drop in blood glucose due to the two units delivered at 12 pm as shown in the figure below. \n\n\n\n\nScheduled Basal Rates\n\u2301\n\n\nIn traditional basal/bolus pump therapy, basal rates are set to accommodate the user's endogenous glucose production (EGP) that causes blood glucose to rise. If a user's basal settings were exactly right in traditional pump therapy, the user would have perfectly flat blood glucose all day, all other factors being equal.\n\n\nIn reality, people with type 1 diabetes, and their caregivers, know that basal settings are never exactly right. Every day is a little different, and a myriad of factors that affect blood glucose (e.g., including stress, hormones, sleep, etc.) may affect insulin needs. Some people have different basal profiles to accommodate these variations. Some people regularly tune and adjust their basal rates, and/or do so at their endocrinology clinic visits.\n\n\nSince the Loop algorithm assumes that the user-set basal rates are reasonably correct, it calculates the effect of insulin relative to scheduled basal rates. If basal rates are not entirely correct, Loop can compensate a bit through the retrospective correction and blood glucose momentum effects, discussed later in this document.\n\n\nThe insulin delivery chart below displays a bar-graph history of the temporary basal rates enacted by Loop. The display is relative to the scheduled basal rates entered in the Loop settings. A rate displayed in this chart as +0 would indicate that no temporary basal rate was set and that the basal rate being delivered was the scheduled basal rate. Positive values indicate a temporary basal rate was set above the scheduled basal rate (i.e., more insulin delivered), and negative values indicate that a temporary basal rate was set below the scheduled basal rate (i.e., less insulin delivered).\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if the user\u2019s scheduled basal rate is 1 U/hr, and Loop gives a temporary basal rate of 3 U/hr, then it will calculate the expected drop in blood glucose due to +2 U/hr of insulin.\n\n\nSimilarly if Loop sets a temporary basal rate of 0 U/hr for 1 hour, then the insulin effect will also be relative to the current scheduled basal rate of 1 U/hr, and Loop would predict the user\u2019s blood glucose to increase by the amount of change from -1 U/hr of insulin. If the user\u2019s ISF is 50 mg/dL, then Loop would predict blood glucose to rise 50 mg/dL over the insulin activity duration (6 hours). \n\n\nHere is a real-world example where Loop is setting many temporary basal rates over the the course of the day. The light orange bars are the temporary basal rates delivered and the solid orange line is the active insulin at any given time during the day.  \n\n\n\n\nTotal Insulin Effect (combining boluses and temporary basal rates)\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop will combine or stack the active insulin of all the discrete (individual) boluses and temporary basal rates over the past insulin activity duration (6 hours), to predict the active insulin for the next 6 hours. As demonstrated above, using the predicted active insulin Loop can predict the blood glucose drop over the next 6 hours. \n\n\nLastly, the combined effect of bolus and basal insulin are visually represented for the user by Loop\u2019s insulin charts:\n\n\n\n\nThe insulin effect can be expressed mathematically:\n\n\n\n\nwhere BG is the expected change in blood glucose with the units (mg/dL/5min), ISF is the insulin sensitivity factor (mg/dL/U) at timet, and IA is the insulin activity (U/5min)at time \nt\n. Insulin activity can also be thought of as a velocity or rate of change in blood glucose due to insulin. The insulin activity accounts for the EGP and any active insulin from basals and boluses.\n\n\nCarbohydrate Effect\n\u2301\n\n\nCarbohydrates will raise blood glucose, but the speed and degree to which they impact blood glucose is dependent on the type of carbohydrates. High glycemic index (GI) carbohydrates will raise blood glucose quickly over a shorter time, whereas low GI foods will raise blood glucose more slowly over a longer period. Foods like candy, juice, and fruits tend to be high GI foods, while pizza, burritos, and quesadillas are usually lower GI foods. Digestion issues like gastroparesis may also contribute to variations in carbohydrate absorption.\n\n\nBecause carbohydrate absorption can be quite variable, Loop has a model that dynamically adjusts the expected remaining time of carbohydrate absorption. To start with, Loop allows the user to input a rough guess of how long they think the food or drink will take to absorb. The user\u2019s guess is used as a middle of the road estimate, and Loop\u2019s algorithm will shorten or lengthen it based on observed blood glucose change.\n\n\nFor all carbohydrate entries, Loop assumes carbohydrates will not start absorbing for 10 minutes, so there is a 10-minute period of no absorption that is modeled prior to the absorption modeled in the next sections.\n\n\nLinear Carbohydrate Absorption\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop takes a conservative view of how fast remaining carbohydrates will absorb.  Because it is safer to under-deliver insulin for long duration meals, Loop starts out at a minimum rate of absorption based on extending the entered carbohydrate duration by 50%. Said another way, the minimum carbohydrate absorption rate is the total number of grams of carbohydrates over 150% of the entered duration. \n\n\nUsing this initial minimum absorption rate, remaining carbohydrates are modeled to absorb linearly. For example, if the user enters a 72g carbohydrate meal, and selects an estimated absorption time of 4 hours, then Loop will forecast a 12g/hr absorption rate for the next 6 hours. This rate can be termed the minimum absorption rate, which can be represented mathematically as:\n\n\n\n\nwhere MAR is the minimum absorption rate (g/hr), CA is the amount of carbohydrates (g) and d is the expected duration (hr) it will take the carbohydrates to absorb. \n\n\nDynamic Carbohydrate Absorption\n\u2301\n\n\nThe linear model above is modulated by an additional calculation that uses recent observed blood glucose data to estimate how fast carbohydrates have been absorbing. The expected change in blood glucose due to insulin effects alone is compared to the actual observed changes in blood glucose. This difference is termed the insulin counteraction effect (ICE):\n\n\n\n\nwhere, ICE (mg/dL/5 min) is the insulin counteraction effect, OA is the observed activity (mg/dL/5min) or observed change in blood glucose at time \nt\n, and IA is the insulin activity (mg/dL/5min). \n\n\nInsulin counteraction effects are caused by more than just carbohydrates, and can include exercise, sensitivity changes, or mis-set insulin delivery settings (e.g., basal rate, ISF, etc.). However, since the effect of carbohydrates is often dominant (after insulin), Loop can still make useful ongoing adjustments to its carbohydrate model by assuming that the an increase in blood glucose is mainly carbohydrate absorption in the period following recorded meal entries.  \n\n\nThe insulin counteraction effect is converted into an estimated carbohydrate absorption amount by using the current carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio and the insulin sensitivity factor at the time of the recorded meal entry.\n\n\n\n\nwhere AC is the amount of carbohydrates absorbed (g/5min), ICE is the insulin counteraction effect, CIR is the carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio (g/U), and ISF is the insulin sensitivity factor (mg/dL/U) at time \nt\n. \n\n\nIf multiple meal entries are active (i.e., still absorbing), the estimated absorption is split between each carbohydrate entry in proportion to each carbohydrate entry\u2019s minimum absorption rate. For example, if 72g carbohydrates with an expected absorption time of 4 hours was consumed at 12 pm, and another 72g of carbohydrates with an expected absorption time of 2 hours was consumed at 3 pm, then the minimum absorption rate (see MAR equation above) would be 12 g/hr and 6 g/hr respectively, or 1 g/5min and 0.5 g/5min.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamining just the simple linear carbohydrate effect of these two meals:\n\n\n\n\nIf we further expand this example, by assuming the following at 4pm:\n\n\n\n\nthat there are still carbohydrates left to be absorbed from both meals, \n\n\nthat the estimated insulin counteraction effect (ICE) is +15 \n, and \n\n\nthe user\u2019s CIR is 10 g/U and the ISF is 50 mg/dL/U,\n\n\n\n\nthen the estimated amount of carbohydrates absorbed at 4pm would be 3g:\n\n\n\n\nThose 3g of carbohydrates would then be split amongst the meals proportional to their minimum absorption rates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresulting in 2g of absorption being attributed to Meal 1 and 1g attributed to Meal 2.\n\n\nMinimum Carbohydrate Absorption Rate\n\u2301\n\n\nIf the estimated carbohydrate absorption of a meal entry is less what would have been absorbed using the minimum absorption rate, then the minimum absorption rate is used instead. This is to ensure that meal entries expire in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nModeling Remaining Active Carbohydrates\n\u2301\n\n\nAfter the estimated absorbed carbohydrates have been subtracted from each meal entry, the remaining carbohydrates (for each entry) are then forecasted to decay or absorb using the minimum absorption rate. Loop uses this forecast to estimate the effect (active carbohydrates, or carbohydrate activity) of the remaining carbohydrates. The carbohydrate effect can be expressed mathematically using the terms described above:\n\n\n\n\nRetrospective Correction Effect\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nThe retrospective correction effect allows the Loop algorithm to account for effects that are not modeled with the insulin and carbohydrate effects, by comparing historical predictions to the actual blood glucose.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the modeled effects of insulin and carbohydrates, there are many other factors that affect blood glucose (e.g., exercise, stress, hormones, etc.). Many of these effects are active for a period of time. By observing its own forecast error, Loop can estimate the magnitude of these effects and, by assuming that they will continue for some short period of time, incorporate them into the forecast to improve forecast accuracy.\n\n\nTo do this, Loop calculates a retrospective forecast with a start time of 30 minutes in the past, ending at the current time. Loop compares the retrospective forecast to the actual observed change in blood glucose, and the difference is summed into a blood glucose velocity or rate of difference:\n\n\n\n\nwhere BG\nvel\n is a velocity term (mg/dL per 5min) that represents the average blood glucose difference between the retrospective forecast (RF) and the actual blood glucose (BG) over the last 30 minutes. This term is applied to the current forecast from the insulin and carb effects with a linear decay over the next hour. For example, the first forecast point (t=5) is approximately 100% of this velocity, the forecast point one half hour from now is adjusted by 50% of the velocity, and points from one hour or more in the future are not affected by this term.\n\n\nThe retrospective correction effect can be expressed mathematically:\n\n\n\n\nwhere BG is the predicted change in blood glucose with the units (mg/dL/5min) at time \nt\n over the time range of 5 to 60 minutes, and the other term gives the percentage of BG\nvel\n that is applied to this effect.\n\n\nThe retrospective correction effect can be illustrated with an example: if the BG\nvel\n over the past 30 minutes was -10 mg/dL per 5min, then the retrospective correction effect over the next 60 minutes would be as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinutes relative to now (\nt=0\n)\n\n\nPercent of BG\nvel\n Applied to RC Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n100%\n\n\n-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n91%\n\n\n-9.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n82%\n\n\n-8.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n73%\n\n\n-7.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n64%\n\n\n-6.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n55%\n\n\n-5.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n45%\n\n\n-4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n36%\n\n\n-3.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n27%\n\n\n-2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n18%\n\n\n-1.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\n9%\n\n\n-0.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n0%\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an example below that shows the retrospective correction effect when the BG\nvel\n over the past 30 minutes was -10mg/dL/5min.   \n\n\n\n\nBlood Glucose Momentum Effect\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nThe blood glucose momentum effect incorporates a prediction component based on the assumption that recent blood glucose trends tend to persist for a short period of time. In other words, the best predictor of the future is the recent past.\n\n\n\n\nThe blood glucose momentum portion of the algorithm gives weight or importance to recent blood glucose to improve the near-future forecast. Loop calculates the slope of the last 3 continuous CGM readings (i.e., the last 15 minutes) using linear regression. Using multiple points helps filter out noise in the CGM data while still responding fast to changing situations. That momentum slope (Mslope) is the approximate or average rate of change over the last 15 minutes, though it is normalized to 5 minutes so that the units are (mg/dL/5min). \n\n\nThe momentum slope is then blended into the next 20 minutes of predicted blood glucose from the other effects (i.e., insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction effects). This, in essence, makes the next 20 minutes of blood glucose prediction more sensitive to recent blood glucose trends. The blending of the recent trend slope into the next 20 minutes is weighted so that the first prediction point (5 minutes into the future) is highly influenced by the slope, and the influence of the slope gradually decays over the 20 minute time period. The momentum effect can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: The term \n is also applied to the combined insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction effects to get the delta blood glucose prediction. \n\n\nThe momentum effect can be illustrated with an example: if the last 3 blood glucose readings were 100, 103, and 106 mg/dL, then the slope would be 3 mg/dL per 5 minutes (0.6 mg/dL per minute). The amount of that recent trend or slope applied to the next 20 minutes of predictions (i.e., the next 4 predictions from the other effects) is roughly 100% (3 mg/dL per 5 min) at 5 minutes, 66% (2 mg/dL per 5 min) at 10 minutes, 33% (1 mg/dL per 5 min) at 15 minutes, and 0% (0 mg/dL per 5 min) at 20 minutes.\n\n\nAlso, if the combined effect from the insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction is assumed to be a constant 6 mg/dL/5min over the next 20 minutes, then the expected overall effect and the predicted blood glucose can be calculated as follows. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinutes relative to now (\nt=0\n)\n\n\nPercent of Slope Applied to Momentum Effect\n\n\nMomentum Effect (3mg/dL/5min)\n\n\nPercent of Other Effects Applied Overall Effect\n\n\nOther Effects (Insulin, Carbohydrate, and Retrospective Correction)\n\n\nOverall Effect (mg/dL/5min)\n\n\nPredicted BG (mg/dL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n100%\n\n\n3\n\n\n0\n\n\n6\n\n\n3\n\n\n109\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n66.6%\n\n\n2\n\n\n33.3%\n\n\n6\n\n\n4\n\n\n113\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n33.3%\n\n\n1\n\n\n66.6%\n\n\n6\n\n\n5\n\n\n118\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n0%\n\n\n0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n124\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example is illustrated in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that Loop will not calculate blood glucose momentum in instances where CGM data is not continuous (i.e., must have at least three continuous CGM readings to draw the best-fit straight line trend). It also will not calculate blood glucose momentum when the last three CGM readings contain any calibration points, as those may not be representative of true blood glucose momentum trends. \n\n\nPredicting Glucose\n\u2301\n\n\nAs described in the momentum effect section, the momentum effect is blended with the insulin, carbohydrate, and retrospective correction effects to predict the change in blood glucose:\n\n\n\n\nLastly, the forecast or predicted blood glucose BG at time \nt\n is the current blood glucose BG plus the sum of all blood glucose effects BG over the time interval [t5, t]:\n\n\n\n\nEach individual effect along with the combined effects are illustrated in the figure below. As shown, blood glucose is trending slightly upwards at the time of the prediction. Therefore, the blood glucose momentum effect\u2019s contribution is pulling up the overall prediction from the other three effects for a short time. Retrospective correction is having a dampening effect on the prediction, indicating that the recent rise in blood glucose was not as great as had been previously predicted in the recent past.",

Loop provides users with two different classes of insulin models (i.e., an exponential model and the Walsh model).

The rapid-acting and Fiasp insulin activity curves are modeled as exponential curves that match the shape of the insulin activity curves from insulin labeling, and as observed in both adults and children.

If a user's basal settings were exactly right in traditional pump therapy, the user would have perfectly flat blood glucose all day, all other factors being equal.  In reality, people with type 1 diabetes, and their caregivers, know that basal settings are never exactly right. Every day is a little different, and a myriad of factors that affect blood glucose (e.g., including stress, hormones, sleep, etc.) may affect insulin needs. Some people have different basal profiles to accommodate these variations. Some people regularly tune and adjust their basal rates, and/or do so at their endocrinology clinic visits.  Since the Loop algorithm assumes that the user-set basal rates are reasonably correct, it calculates the effect of insulin relative to scheduled basal rates. If basal rates are not entirely correct, Loop can compensate a bit through the retrospective correction and blood glucose momentum effects, discussed later in this document.  The insulin delivery chart below displays a bar-graph history of the temporary basal rates enacted by Loop. The display is relative to the scheduled basal rates entered in the Loop settings. A rate displayed in this chart as +0 would indicate that no temporary basal rate was set and that the basal rate being delivered was the scheduled basal rate. Positive values indicate a temporary basal rate was set above the scheduled basal rate (i.e., more insulin delivered), and negative values indicate that a temporary basal rate was set below the scheduled basal rate (i.e., less insulin delivered).   For example, if the user\u2019s scheduled basal rate is 1 U/hr, and Loop gives a temporary basal rate of 3 U/hr, then it will calculate the expected drop in blood glucose due to +2 U/hr of insulin.  Similarly if Loop sets a temporary basal rate of 0 U/hr for 1 hour, then the insulin effect will also be relative to the current scheduled basal rate of 1 U/hr, and Loop would predict the user\u2019s blood glucose to increase by the amount of change from -1 U/hr of insulin. If the user\u2019s ISF is 50 mg/dL, then Loop would predict blood glucose to rise 50 mg/dL over the insulin activity duration (6 hours).

For example, the first forecast point (t=5) is approximately 100% of this velocity, the forecast point one half hour from now is adjusted by 50% of the velocity, and points from one hour or more in the future are not affected by this term.  The retrospective correction effect can be expressed mathematically:   where BG is the predicted change in blood glucose with the units (mg/dL/5min) at time  t  over the time range of 5 to 60 minutes, and the other term gives the percentage of BG vel  that is applied to this effect.  The retrospective correction effect can be illustrated with an example: if the BG vel  over the past 30 minutes was -10 mg/dL per 5min, then the retrospective correction effect over the next 60 minutes would be as follows:     Minutes relative to now ( t=0 )  Percent of BG vel  Applied to RC Effect       5  100%  -10     10  91%  -9.1    15  82%  -8.2    20  73%  -7.3    25  64%  -6.4    30  55%  -5.5    35  45%  -4.5    40  36%  -3.6    45  27%  -2.7    50  18%  -1.8    55  9%  -0.9    60  0%  0     Here\u2019s an example below that shows the retrospective correction effect when the BG vel  over the past 30 minutes was -10mg/dL/5min.",

            "text": "The blood glucose momentum effect incorporates a prediction component based on the assumption that recent blood glucose trends tend to persist for a short period of time. In other words, the best predictor of the future is the recent past.   The blood glucose momentum portion of the algorithm gives weight or importance to recent blood glucose to improve the near-future forecast. Loop calculates the slope of the last 3 continuous CGM readings (i.e., the last 15 minutes) using linear regression. Using multiple points helps filter out noise in the CGM data while still responding fast to changing situations. That momentum slope (Mslope) is the approximate or average rate of change over the last 15 minutes, though it is normalized to 5 minutes so that the units are (mg/dL/5min).   The momentum slope is then blended into the next 20 minutes of predicted blood glucose from the other effects (i.e., insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction effects). This, in essence, makes the next 20 minutes of blood glucose prediction more sensitive to recent blood glucose trends. The blending of the recent trend slope into the next 20 minutes is weighted so that the first prediction point (5 minutes into the future) is highly influenced by the slope, and the influence of the slope gradually decays over the 20 minute time period. The momentum effect can be expressed mathematically as:   NOTE: The term   is also applied to the combined insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction effects to get the delta blood glucose prediction.   The momentum effect can be illustrated with an example: if the last 3 blood glucose readings were 100, 103, and 106 mg/dL, then the slope would be 3 mg/dL per 5 minutes (0.6 mg/dL per minute). The amount of that recent trend or slope applied to the next 20 minutes of predictions (i.e., the next 4 predictions from the other effects) is roughly 100% (3 mg/dL per 5 min) at 5 minutes, 66% (2 mg/dL per 5 min) at 10 minutes, 33% (1 mg/dL per 5 min) at 15 minutes, and 0% (0 mg/dL per 5 min) at 20 minutes.  Also, if the combined effect from the insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction is assumed to be a constant 6 mg/dL/5min over the next 20 minutes, then the expected overall effect and the predicted blood glucose can be calculated as follows.      Minutes relative to now ( t=0 )  Percent of Slope Applied to Momentum Effect  Momentum Effect (3mg/dL/5min)  Percent of Other Effects Applied Overall Effect  Other Effects (Insulin, Carbohydrate, and Retrospective Correction)  Overall Effect (mg/dL/5min)  Predicted BG (mg/dL)      5  100%  3  0  6  3  109     10  66.6%  2  33.3%  6  4  113    15  33.3%  1  66.6%  6  5  118    20  0%  0  100%  6  6  124     This example is illustrated in the figure below.   It is also worth noting that Loop will not calculate blood glucose momentum in instances where CGM data is not continuous (i.e., must have at least three continuous CGM readings to draw the best-fit straight line trend). It also will not calculate blood glucose momentum when the last three CGM readings contain any calibration points, as those may not be representative of true blood glucose momentum trends.",

As shown, blood glucose is trending slightly upwards at the time of the prediction. Therefore, the blood glucose momentum effect\u2019s contribution is pulling up the overall prediction from the other three effects for a short time.

Loop also does its math based on predicting into the future, which traditional pumps and humans, do not always have the time or inclination to do.\n\n\nThe amount of insulin needed, or dose, is calculated using the desired reduction in blood glucose and the user\u2019s ISF.

Just be patient, and they almost always correct themselves.  Yellow loops happen sometimes, and aren't usually worth troubleshooting.  Red loops are more infrequent and usually a good time to start investigating possible source.  \nSome environments will be noisy for rf comms (such as concerts, amusement parks, tech venues, conferences with OpenAPS users in attendance, etc.), and your loop may not stay green as often as usual.  Just be patient. When you leave that environment, looping will go back to normal.\n  Wireless microphones, baby monitors, and other similar types of devices can interfer with pump communications if there are lots of competing radio devices in a tight environment.  If you find you have areas of your house that consistently have poor pump communications, look for potential sources of interference from wireless devices.\n\n\nAnother common area for failed pump communications are at night if you tend to sleep on your pump, or otherwise \"body block\" the RL's ability to communicate with the pump.  Try to place your pump and RL such that your body will not block the signal to/from RL.  Standing the RL on it's base with antenna pointing up, on a nearby nightstand should be sufficient proximity/orientation for overnight looping.\n\n\nThese examples below are pump error messages.  Notice they all mention the pump specifically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncorrect Pump Time (Pump Issue)\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nAnd here's an interesting problem.  BGs are current, but notice that the pump time is 2 hours into the future of the current iPhone time.  In this case, the Loop user had manually set their pump time during travels and caused the pump time to be out of sync with Loop.  Remember, \ndo not change your pump time manually...always use the RL to set the pump time\n.  This red loop was resolved as soon as the Looper used RL to set the pump time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure to Enact Temp Basals (Pump Issue)\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nIf you see messages about \"Could not verify TempBasal on attempt  2\", that is likely one of just a few issues.  The message indicates that Loop has BGs and pump data, has sent a recommended basal to the pump, but the pump does not appear to be enacting those basals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour pump cannot be suspended.  Resume insulin deliveries\n\n\nMax basal rate in Loop app cannot be greater than max basal rate in pump settings\n\n\nTemp basal type must be set to unit/hour, not percent, in pump\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluetooth/RL issues\n\u2301\n\n\nBluetooth failures (RL or iPhone issue)\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nSometimes the RilleyLink and iPhone fail to communicate via BT.  You need to determine if this is due to RL's problems, iPhone's problems, or just BT communications problem.  There can be messages when BT fails, such as the message below, or \"RileyLink Timeout\" error messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHas your RL been fully charged? Try charging your RL for an hour or two, make sure the red light comes on while charging\n\n\nIs your lipo battery old and perhaps dying earlier in the day?  Order a new battery, replace lipo battery\n\n\nCheck your lipo battery wires?  If your wires are dislodged from the lipo itself, RL will not likely work for long\n\n\nYour RL battery needs to be securely plugged in, check those connections.\n\n\nCheck if your RL is on and says \"connected\" in the \nstatus screen for bluetooth\n. If it says \"connecting\" or \"disconnected\", you have a BT problem with RL and iPhone.\n\n\nMake sure your iPhone's BT is turned on, and BT is not being affected by other BT systems (such as car audio)\n\n\nCheck if any of the RL command buttons work...such as \nSend Button Press\n.\n\n\nIf you've checked all of the above, toggle your RL power switch and turn your iPhone BT off/on.  Try rebooting your phone.  If those steps don't work and the RL is properly charging otherwise, likely you have a bad RileyLink and will need to replace it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop Settings Issues\n\u2301\n\n\nFailure to set Insulin Curve Model (Loop settings)\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nIf you see messages about \"Missing data: Glucose effects\", you likely have \nforgotten to set your Insulin Curve Model\n.

So long as you are putting in a reservoir that has more insulin than the old one, IOB will be accurate in Loop.  When Loop sees a rewind and an increase in reservoir volume, it will not count any tubing primes as IOB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you change sites but \ndo NOT increase reservoir volume\n (i.e., you keep existing reservoir going), you will need to go into Loop's reservoir history and delete 30 minutes of continuous reservoir history including the prime event.

If you don't finish the priming menu, the pump will not begin basal insulin delivery, nor does it alarm.  It is equivalent to the pump being suspended...but you won't be able to see any indication of that in Nightscout as a remotely monitoring parent other than Loop's temp basals not being set.  Loop will not detect the prime screen issue and will keep sending temp basal messages...but the pump won't enact them.  On Loop, you could notice it by the active IOB continually going down and then eventually negative IOB, as the basal is not delivered and the reservoir level remains constant.  However, the temp basal graph will still show the bars from the temp basal commands loop has been sending.\n\n\nSo, remember to finish those prime menu screens through to the end.",

You will need to have your Preferred Data Source set to Event History for the automatic detection of primes to work.   Reservoir Volumes will not detect prime events.   If you are using a version of Loop older than v1.3.2 (or using Preferred Data Source of Reservoir Volume), you will need to be aware of the following regarding prime events at site changes:    If you change sites and increase reservoir volume (i.e., start a new reservoir), don't worry. So long as you are putting in a reservoir that has more insulin than the old one, IOB will be accurate in Loop.  When Loop sees a rewind and an increase in reservoir volume, it will not count any tubing primes as IOB.    If you change sites but  do NOT increase reservoir volume  (i.e., you keep existing reservoir going), you will need to go into Loop's reservoir history and delete 30 minutes of continuous reservoir history including the prime event.  By deleting 30 minutes of reservoir history, Loop will use Event History to determine insulin deliveries and IOB. If you cannot get the prime to clear from the IOB, operate in Open Loop mode until the insulin action duration time has passed.  Deleting history is done by:  (1)  clicking on the Insulin Delivery Chart    (2)  selecting the Reservoir history screen    (3)  swiping to delete individual reservoir readings    (4)  delete at least 30 minutes of reservoir readings, including the readings that involved priming events",

It is equivalent to the pump being suspended...but you won't be able to see any indication of that in Nightscout as a remotely monitoring parent other than Loop's temp basals not being set.  Loop will not detect the prime screen issue and will keep sending temp basal messages...but the pump won't enact them.  On Loop, you could notice it by the active IOB continually going down and then eventually negative IOB, as the basal is not delivered and the reservoir level remains constant.

Most pumps will show an A21 error when you first purchase them on the used market.  Not a big deal.  Press the down arrow (also has the symbol of a light bulb on it) and the pump screen message will scroll down to let you know how to clear that error message (press ESC then ACT).  If the message is coming up on a pump that hasn't been in storage, pull the battery out and replace with a fresh, new battery.  Chances are your battery or battery cap are old.  Look for signs of dirt or rust in the battery cap, give it a little cleaning.\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Tip\n\n\nWhen the pump screen has a little black/white bar on the right side, that is a scroll bar.  Use the arrow keys on the right of the the pump screen to scroll and see the additional information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatt Out Limit\n\u2301\n\n\nThis error message \"battery out of limits\" has to do with the internal pump battery, not the AAA battery you replace.  The internal battery cannot be replaced, and unfortunately also has a finite lifespan.  The error message is more of an annoyance than a true problem.  You can try to change the AAA battery faster.  But, the worst case scenario is that you'll have to re-enter the time and date when you get this message more often.  (Don't forget to use RileyLink to set the time after you get this message.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButton Error\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Button Error message usually happens from water, moisture, or dust getting under the pump's button pad and causing button(s) to fail.  The fix luckily is quite straight-forward and takes less than 30 minutes.  Check out the fix \nhere for a YouTube video\n or \nhere for photo gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution involves simply prying up the button pad's sticker face to expose the layers beneath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see some evidence of crud/rust on the underside of this button pad which caused the button error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you finish your fix, another excellent idea is to make sure you add a length of clear packing tape across the front face of the pump to prevent errant water or dirt from having easy access to the button pad seams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrack/Missing Piece Repairs\n\u2301\n\n\nAnother common issue on these Medtronic pumps are cracks and/or missing bits of plastic near the battery cap or reservoir sleeve. You can repair these fairly easily. For filling small cracks, \nTestor's plastic cement\n or \nGorilla epoxy\n are good choices.\n\n\nFor more extensive repairs to replace missing chunks of plastic, \nGorilla epoxy\n or \nSugru\n are excellent choices.  \n\n\nYou can use \nteflon thread tape\n on the battery cap to make sure the epoxy or Sugru don't stick to the battery cap, but still recreate the threads.  The first photos are of a Sugru repair and second set of photos are Gorilla epoxy repair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotor error\n\u2301\n\n\nOften a motor error is the result of a poorly seated reservoir or tubing cap.  If you get a motor error, the first thing you should do is detach from your infusion site.  Remove and reseat the reservoir, prime again, and see if the motor error resolves.  If it does not, try replacing the tubing cap on the reservoir (new tubing).  If that does not resolve the motor error, also replace the entire reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA33 error\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nSafety warning\n\n\nIf you get this error, DO NOT push on the bulged out end cap.  Always detach your tubing from your infusion set before addressing this error message.  If you push on the end cap in an attempt to get it back flush, you may delivery a dangerous amount of insulin mistakenly.\n\n\n\n\nThis error is a bit more involved to repair.  The problem is that there is a loose drive support cap.  Most of the time this error message will appear during a priming event as the end cap of the drive will slip, releasing the ability of the reservoir plunger to get pressure to delivery insulin.  The pump senses the lack of pressure and delivers the A33 error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution is to UNHOOK from your site.  See warning above.  Remove reservoir and put your finger inside the reservoir sleeve.  Push on the drive so that the end cap is pushed out the most possible.  This will give your the most surface area possible to place the super glue GEL that you will use.  (don't use regular super glue...it must be gel.)  Remove the sticker that covers the end cap, save it for later because you can reattach when repair is completed.\n\n\nWith the end cap pushed out, take some glue gel with the toothpick and apply it on the outside of the popped out cap . Be generous cause you can do this only once . Once you are done take a napkin and press hard the cap toward the pump so it can go back inside and keep it pressed for a few seconds. Then remove all the small parts of the napkin that has glued to the pump. Leave the pump to dry for about 10-15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow to test whether the pumps was glued well. You have already waited about 10-15 minutes so put your finger back in and press hard the plunger.  If you glued it well, the end cap will not move.  If the cap goes out again, you have to glue one more time. If all looks well, put some glue back on top of the pump cap and reattach the sticker that was removed to start.\n\n\nA32 and E22 error loop\n\u2301\n\n\nFrom what we know, this set of error codes seems like a pump killer.  A call to Medtronic support gave this less than hopeful information:\n\n\nA32 - failure of flash memory\nE22 - software re-installation is necessary\n\n\nWe don't have any reports of a good fix for these error codes.

            "text": "Overview\n\u2301\n\n\nNightscout (NS) is an excellent tool to remotely view Loop's actions.  It allows for easy remote monitoring of Loop activities, troubleshooting of Loop errors, history of CGM, carbs, boluses, \n temp basals, reports to analyze data trends and patterns. There is a Nightscout app in your iPhone App Store, or you can use a web browser to view the data.  Setting up Nightscout is free and fairly quick.  Once setup, the site can be accessed by anyone that you share your unique Nightscout URL with.  \n\n\nNightscout is highly recommended for Loop users, especially those using Loop as caregivers to t1ds.  Nightscout displays are often the easiest way to troubleshoot Loop settings, if you are having problems and seeking input from others.  Below is some discussion about the general Nightscout display, as well as some Loop-specific display information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood Glucose\n\u2301\n\n\nYour blood glucose (BG) readings from your CGM are shown in green, yellow, or red in the main graph area of NS.  You can adjust your high and low BG targets in NS (when NS alerts will start for high/low BGs), but those will not affect your Loop performance.  Loop only uses the BG targets given in the Loop app settings.  The main screen of BGs is displaying the time duration you have selected (in the example above, 12 hours of BG history).  The bottom of the screen shows the last 48-hours of BG trends.  You can scan backwards by dragging the bottom timeline to the left, if you want to review specific Loop actions or data in the last two days. \n\n\n\n\nSAGE, CAGE, BAGE pills\n\u2301\n\n\nThe SAGE, CAGE, and BAGE pills are for Sensor Age, Cannula Age, and (pump) Battery Age.  These optional pills track the time since your CGM sensor, Pump site, and Pump battery were last changed.  You can set up custom alerts to remind you when it is time to change the devices, or simply use the visuals to keep track of your particular timing for site/sensor changes. These fields will not auto-update from pump or cgm devices, instead you will have to update them using Nightscout Careportal so that the pill information is accurate.\n\n\n\n\nCarbs\n\u2301\n\n\nCarbs are automatically uploaded to NS by the Loop app.  The amount of carbs on board (active carbs or COB) can be seen by clicking the Loop pill.  The size of a white carb dot on the graph is proportional to the amount of carbs entered...bigger meals get bigger dots. Loop does not read carbs from NS for use in looping caluclations, it only uploads carbs to NS that have been entered in the Loop app.\n\n\n\n\nBoluses\n\u2301\n\n\nInsulin boluses are also automatically uploaded to NS by the Loop app.  The bolus is shown as a filled in blue lower-half of the dot, and the specific amount of the bolus is also shown.  There may be a slight delay between when the carbs for a meal are uploaded to NS to when the meal bolus appears.  This is because depending on the pump model and size of bolus, the bolus may take a few minutes to actually be given and then Loop has to perform a pump read to verify the reservoir volume has decreased (i.e., the bolus was given).  As shown in the example above, the meal carbs have been uploaded, but the bolus delivery is still in progress.  Insulin on board (active insulin or IOB) is also shown in the Loop pill.\n\n\n\n\nTemp Basals\n\u2301\n\n\nWithin your NS profile, you will enter in the scheduled basal for your Loop user.  This is not automatically updated when you update the Loop app or your pump; you will have to manually update your basal profile in your NS site if you change your basal profile in Loop and/or pump.  If you don't update the NS basal profile, it doesn't cause any problems in Loop function...you simply won't have accurate VISUAL representation of high/low temp basals within NS. The dashed blue line represents the scheduled basal profile (as entered in your NS profile).  The solid blue lines indicate the actual basal amounts set for a given time...so as Loop sets temp basals higher or lower than your scheduled basal rate, the solid blue line will jump above or below your dashed blue line.  There is a slight delay (up to 2-5 minutes) in the rendering of basal changes on the blue lines, so if you want the accurate current basal rate, you can check the Loop pill.\n\n\n\n\nPredicted BG\n\u2301\n\n\nThe purple line to the right of the BG is Loop's predicted BG.  Watching the behavior of that purple line can help you understand why Loop is making decisions regarding high or low temps.  You can read more on that topic in the Algorithm section of these docs.\n\n\n\n\nLoop pill\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Loop pill is the little display box which when hovered over, or clicked, will provide additional information about recent Loop activities and status.  Information included is the last time Loop ran, the temp basal set, IOB, and COB.  Looking at the Loop pill is a quick method for assessing if you loop is currently active, as well.\n\n\n\n\nLoop Pill status indicator symbols\n\n\nX\n \n\nError in Loop\n\n\n\u03d5\n \n\nRecommending basal, but not enacting (open loop or pump suspended)\n\n\n\u2301\n \n\nEnacted a new temp basal\n\n\n\u21bb\n \n\nLoop is continuing with last temp basal, no change\n\n\n\u26a0\n \n\nWarning (Loop has not completed since since the time set on your LOOP_WARN setting in NS)\n\n\n\n\nMouseover or Touch the Loop pill to view a tool tip containing one or more of the latest status messages.

It allows for easy remote monitoring of Loop activities, troubleshooting of Loop errors, history of CGM, carbs, boluses,   temp basals, reports to analyze data trends and patterns. There is a Nightscout app in your iPhone App Store, or you can use a web browser to view the data.  Setting up Nightscout is free and fairly quick.  Once setup, the site can be accessed by anyone that you share your unique Nightscout URL with.    Nightscout is highly recommended for Loop users, especially those using Loop as caregivers to t1ds.  Nightscout displays are often the easiest way to troubleshoot Loop settings, if you are having problems and seeking input from others.  Below is some discussion about the general Nightscout display, as well as some Loop-specific display information.",

Loop only uses the BG targets given in the Loop app settings.  The main screen of BGs is displaying the time duration you have selected (in the example above, 12 hours of BG history).  The bottom of the screen shows the last 48-hours of BG trends.

We can achieve this functionality through a combination of Nightscout, IFTTT, Google, and Pushover.\n\n\nTraditionally, most people may already know of Pushover alerts through their NS site.  The old Loop docs had setup for how to add your \nPUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY\n , \nPUSHOVER_API_TOKEN\n, and \nPUSHOVER_USER_KEY\n in your Heroku settings to get notifications on the non-looping phones of parents and caregivers.  The drawback for that method is that you could not necessarily fine tune the alerts (maybe you wanted battery alarms on your NS website, but not get pushovers for them...a bit hard to separate out the environments that way) and Pushover had a demanding acknowledgement requirement.  If you failed to acknowledge an alert, you may end up getting alarm fatigue fairly quickly as the alarm repeated itself.\n\n\nUsing Pushover \nTHROUGH\n IFTTT however, we can improve the possible notifications and who receives which ones.  For example, a teenage Looper may want notifications when his/her pump site needs changing and when his/her dexcom is about to expire in the next day.  S/he already gets local notifications on his/her phone via Loop for low reservoir volumes, low pump battery, and Loop failures.  Dexcom app provides high/low BG notifications locally, too.  If s/he were to get those same alarms via Pushover, s/he would inevitably get alarm fatigue.  A remotely-monitoring parent may want additional information, like a pushover alerts when the school nurse bolused for lunch, as well as Loop failures, low iPhone battery level for the child, low pump battery, and other such information that might be useful.  Perhaps there's also an emergency contact person that you only want to get high/low BG alerts...you can set that up as well quite easily.\n\n\nThe basic concept is that NS puts out an event that triggers the IFTTT service called Webhooks (old name was \"Maker Webhooks\" hence you may see references to \"maker\" in NS docs).  Actually, there are several types of events that NS has programmed in all ready to use in IFTTT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this setup, we are going to use the most general logging event called \nns-event\n.  You'll get all the alarms and notifications logged, and then you can decide in subsequent steps which ones you'd actually like to send to your phone for pushover notification.\n\n\nAs a brief roadmap for what we are going to do:\n\n\n\n\nGet necessary accounts setup\n\n\nAdd a folder to your Google Drive\n\n\nMake an IFTTT applet to log NS events to your Google Spreadsheets\n\n\nEnable NS to work with that new IFTTT applet\n\n\nMake an IFTTT applet to send Pushover alert when the Google Spreadsheet is updated\n\n\n\n\nGet Prepped\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you don't already have these steps done, you will need them.  Skip any that you already have done.\n\n\n\n\nSetup a Nightscout site\n\n\nGet an \nIFTTT account\n\n\nGet a \nPushover Account\n\n\nGet a \nGoogle Account\n\n\nDownload the Pushover app onto your phone, and any other phone you'd like to receive Pushover alerts\n\n\nDownload the IFTTT app onto your phone, and any other phone you'd like to use IFTTT applets on\n\n\nLogin to the Pushover and IFTTT apps with your login information\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Google Drive folder\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nLogin to your Google account and select Google Drive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the blue \"New\" button and create a new folder named IFTTT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the newly created IFTTT folder, select the blue \"New\" button again, and create a new subfolder called \"Nightscout-Alarms\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms folder will eventually contain numerous Google Spreadsheets, one for each NS alarm or infomation that is logged.  As new alarms are triggered, the IFTTT applet we are about to write will add a row to the appropriate spreadsheet logging the time of the alarm and any other reported details that go with the entry.  For now though, your drive will be blank...screenshot below just to give you an idea of where we are going.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake 1st IFTTT Applet to Log NS Alarms\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nLogin to your IFTTT.com account and select the \"New Applet\" button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the screen that appears, click on the blue \"+this\" part of the screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next screen, type \"webhooks\" in the search field and then click on the blue connect button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this is the first time you are using IFTTT Webhooks service, you will have a \"Connect\" button to select.  If you already have IFTTT applets using Webhooks, you won't see this screen...just move to the next bullet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \"receive a web request\" blue box, and then fill in the Event Name as \nns-event\n and then press the \"Create trigger\" button.  (Side note:  the event name used here corresponds to the triggers discussed above for core events that NS already has integrated for IFTTT users.  If you want to instead use the other triggers such as ns-warn or ns-urgent, you can.  This example is using the most general trigger so that the options are wider for most users.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the blue \"+that\" text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter \ngoogle\n in the search field and click on the Google Sheets icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the green \"Add row to spreadsheet\" box\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete the contents of the \"Spreadsheet Name\" and \"Drive folder path\".  For the \"Spreadsheet Name\", click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and select the \"Value1\".  For the \"Drive folder path\", enter \nIFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms\n.  You do not have to modify the \"Formatted row\" box's contents.  Click the \"Create action\" button at the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn off the toggle for receiving notifications when the applet runs, and then click the Finish button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll now have the finished IFTTT applet that will cause a row to be added to a Google spreadsheet...tracking all your NS notifications and alarms.  If it is the first time that alarm has been logged, the applet will also create the spreadsheet itself.  After awhile, your IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms folder will start to look like the screenshot posted above with numerous spreadsheets for each alarm type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable IFTTT Webhooks in your Nightscout site\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nIf you already have created IFTTT buttons previously to work with your NS site, you can skip this section.  If those buttons are working, then you've already added your MAKER_KEY and \"maker\" to your ENABLE line in Heroku.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo actually make that first applet work, we need to enter a \"Maker Key\" to get NS and IFTTT talking to each other.  Find your Maker Key by going to your IFTTT account, Services and then clicking on Webhooks.  (Your screen may not have as many services showing; the example account below just happens to already use several services.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see your Maker Key as the last part of the URL; copy that last part (the red circled part)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your Heroku account's settings tab, \"reveal config vars\" and (1) add your Maker Key to the MAKER_KEY line and (2) add \"maker\" to your ENABLE line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake 2nd IFTTT Applet to send Pushover notifications\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nIn your IFTTT account, select the \"New Applet\" button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the screen that appears, click on the blue \"+this\" part of the screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next screen, type \"google\" in the search field and then click on the \"Google Sheets\" logo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \"New row added to spreadsheet\" as the trigger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the following information:  Folder path is \nIFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms\n and for filename you are going to enter the name of the particular NS alarm or information that you would like to get pushover alerts for.  Click on the \"Create trigger\" button to save the trigger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis applet can't be created unless your filename (alarm spreadsheet) already exists.  If your 1st applet we created above hasn't run for a long time, the spreadsheets may not exist yet because the alarms haven't triggered.  You have two options...(1) manually create the file in your Google Drive so that you can finish the applet now or (2) wait several days/weeks for the alarms to happen and that will automatically create the files in your Google drive.\n\nIf you choose option 1, here's a partial list of some of the filenames you could create in advance:\n\n\n\n\nLoop isn't looping\n\n\nCannula age 48 hours\n\n\nCannula age 72 hours\n\n\nMeal Bolus\n\n\nWarning, Pump Reservoir Low\n\n\nWarning Uploader Battery is Low\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your alert levels you specified in NS, some of the hours in the titles may vary to match your settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the blue \"+that\" text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter \npushover\n in the search field and click on the Pushover icon.  If this is your first time linking your IFTTT to Pushover, you will be prompted to enter your Pushover account login and allow IFTTT access.  This only needs to be done once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \"Send a Pushover notification\" box\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete the contents of the \"Title\" and \"Message\" and \"URL\" boxes.  For the Title, click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and add \nColumnC\n.  For the \"Message\", click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and add the values of various columns from your spreadsheet for the infomation you would like to include.  For the alerts: \nColumnC\n contains the alarm name, \nColumnA\n is the date/time of the alarm, and \nColumnD\n has the more detailed information about the info/alarm.  This is a pretty decent recipe to follow to get the useful information in your notification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \"Message Priority\" that you would like for this particular alarm type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \"Device\" that you would like to receive this particular alarm type.  The devices listed will be all your devices that have Pushover app installed and logged into.  Click \"Create Action\" when you are finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll now have made the IFTTT applet that will cause a Pushover notification to a particular device for a particular NS alarm, once the first applet records the alarm in the google spreadsheet.  Keep the \"receive notification when this Applet runs\" toggled off and click the Finish button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevisit Nightscout Alert Levels\n\u2301\n\n\nPutting all these notifications together may cause you to want to revisit the alert levels you have set in your Heroku settings.  Here's a short summary of NS for the looping-related alerts (Note: the last row, Upbat, is the Looping iPhone battery level for Loop users; or the rig's battery level for OpenAPS users.)  If you'd like some of these alarms for your site and don't currently have them activated (they are all off by default unless specifically turned on), the lines you'd need to add are in the last column.  If you like the default values of the WARN and/or URGENT, you don't have to add those extra lines...just the line to enable the alerts will be sufficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSETTING\n\n\nDEFAULT\nWARN\n\n\nDEFAULT\nURGENT\n\n\nHEROKU\nSETTINGS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAGE\n\n\n48\n\n\n72\n\n\nCAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nCAGE_WARN=XX\nCAGE_URGENT=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAGE\n\n\n164\n\n\n168\n\n\nSAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nSAGE_WARN=XX\nSAGE_URGENT=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIAGE\n\n\n48\n\n\n72\n\n\nIAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nIAGE_WARN=XX\nIAGE_URGENT=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOOP\n\n\n30\n\n\n60\n\n\nLOOP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nLOOP_WARN=XX\nLOOP_URGENT=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPENAPS\n\n\n30\n\n\n60\n\n\nOPENAPS_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nOPENAPS_WARN=XX\nOPENAPS_URGENT=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUMP_CLOCK\n\n\n30\n\n\n60\n\n\nPUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nPUMP_WARN_CLOCK=XX\nPUMP_URGENT_CLOCK=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUMP_RES\n\n\n10\n\n\n5\n\n\nPUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nPUMP_WARN_RES=XX\nPUMP_URGENT_RES=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUMP_BATT_P\n\n\n30\n\n\n20\n\n\nPUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nPUMP_WARN_BATT_P=XX\nPUMP_URGENT_BATT_P=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUMP_BATT_V\n\n\n1.35\n\n\n1.30\n\n\nPUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nPUMP_WARN_BATT_V=XX\nPUMP_URGENT_BATT_V=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPBAT\n\n\n30\n\n\n20\n\n\nUPBAT_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nUPBAT_WARN=XX\nUPBAT_URGENT=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal notes\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use other notification services than Pushover in the last part of the second applet.  For example, you could use the SMS service to send text notifications to your iphone instead of Pushover.  The downside for that is that the SMS service is limited to 100 message each month...some users may exceed that pretty easily.  Another alternative notification would be IFTTT's own Notification service.  This would work well, but does not have the ability to distinguish between devices the way Pushover allows.  If you use IFTTT's Notifications service, every phone using your IFTTT account will get the notices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, you do \nNOT\n need to have pushover on your ENABLE line nor have \nPUSHOVER_USER_KEY\n, \nPUSHOVER_API_TOKEN\n, or \nPUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY\n entered into your Heroku settings in order for any of the above to work.  This is not the same Pushover as NS has integrated into it's code.  This is actually through IFTTT services, you just need a Pushover account to link to during the 2nd applet setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create more notifications, simply repeat the steps for the 2nd applet you created, only this time use a new filename that corresponds to the spreadsheet tracking the alert you'd like notifications for.  You'll end up with multiple applets of the dark blue type (the pushover notifiers) and only a single light blue (NS alarm general collecter).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's examples of the Meal Bolus and Temp Basal ns-event logging spreadsheets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1st applet can only create up to 2000 active rows in a given spreadsheet.  After that, the applet will automatically create a new spreadsheet.  For most alarms, it may take quite sometime to reach 2000 rows of info.  For other alerts, such as temp basals being set, that may fill up rather fast for the average looper.  You can either clean out the data rows periodically to make room, or update your filename in the 2nd applet periodically when a new spreadsheet is made.",

In the screen that appears, click on the blue \"+this\" part of the screen       In the next screen, type \"google\" in the search field and then click on the \"Google Sheets\" logo.       Click on the \"New row added to spreadsheet\" as the trigger.       Enter the following information:  Folder path is  IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms  and for filename you are going to enter the name of the particular NS alarm or information that you would like to get pushover alerts for.  Click on the \"Create trigger\" button to save the trigger.       This applet can't be created unless your filename (alarm spreadsheet) already exists.  If your 1st applet we created above hasn't run for a long time, the spreadsheets may not exist yet because the alarms haven't triggered.  You have two options...(1) manually create the file in your Google Drive so that you can finish the applet now or (2) wait several days/weeks for the alarms to happen and that will automatically create the files in your Google drive. \nIf you choose option 1, here's a partial list of some of the filenames you could create in advance:   Loop isn't looping  Cannula age 48 hours  Cannula age 72 hours  Meal Bolus  Warning, Pump Reservoir Low  Warning Uploader Battery is Low   Depending on your alert levels you specified in NS, some of the hours in the titles may vary to match your settings    Click on the blue \"+that\" text       Enter  pushover  in the search field and click on the Pushover icon.  If this is your first time linking your IFTTT to Pushover, you will be prompted to enter your Pushover account login and allow IFTTT access.  This only needs to be done once.       Select the \"Send a Pushover notification\" box       Delete the contents of the \"Title\" and \"Message\" and \"URL\" boxes.  For the Title, click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and add  ColumnC .  For the \"Message\", click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and add the values of various columns from your spreadsheet for the infomation you would like to include.  For the alerts:  ColumnC  contains the alarm name,  ColumnA  is the date/time of the alarm, and  ColumnD  has the more detailed information about the info/alarm.  This is a pretty decent recipe to follow to get the useful information in your notification.       Select the \"Message Priority\" that you would like for this particular alarm type.       Select the \"Device\" that you would like to receive this particular alarm type.  The devices listed will be all your devices that have Pushover app installed and logged into.  Click \"Create Action\" when you are finished.       You'll now have made the IFTTT applet that will cause a Pushover notification to a particular device for a particular NS alarm, once the first applet records the alarm in the google spreadsheet.  Keep the \"receive notification when this Applet runs\" toggled off and click the Finish button.",

            "text": "You can use other notification services than Pushover in the last part of the second applet.  For example, you could use the SMS service to send text notifications to your iphone instead of Pushover.  The downside for that is that the SMS service is limited to 100 message each month...some users may exceed that pretty easily.  Another alternative notification would be IFTTT's own Notification service.  This would work well, but does not have the ability to distinguish between devices the way Pushover allows.  If you use IFTTT's Notifications service, every phone using your IFTTT account will get the notices.    To be clear, you do  NOT  need to have pushover on your ENABLE line nor have  PUSHOVER_USER_KEY ,  PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN , or  PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY  entered into your Heroku settings in order for any of the above to work.  This is not the same Pushover as NS has integrated into it's code.  This is actually through IFTTT services, you just need a Pushover account to link to during the 2nd applet setup.    To create more notifications, simply repeat the steps for the 2nd applet you created, only this time use a new filename that corresponds to the spreadsheet tracking the alert you'd like notifications for.  You'll end up with multiple applets of the dark blue type (the pushover notifiers) and only a single light blue (NS alarm general collecter).        Here's examples of the Meal Bolus and Temp Basal ns-event logging spreadsheets          The 1st applet can only create up to 2000 active rows in a given spreadsheet.  After that, the applet will automatically create a new spreadsheet.  For most alarms, it may take quite sometime to reach 2000 rows of info.  For other alerts, such as temp basals being set, that may fill up rather fast for the average looper.  You can either clean out the data rows periodically to make room, or update your filename in the 2nd applet periodically when a new spreadsheet is made.",
