And these directions will tell you exactly how to do that, and in particular how to navigate this site to make that easy.\n\n\nWhere do I start? I don't know what Loop is.\n\u2301\n\n\nThe best thing to do is to start by learning about Loop using the FAQs pages. The short answer is that Loop is an iPhone app that helps automate your insulin delivery, based on CGM data and user inputs, to keep blood glucose within range. It requires certain gear (pump, CGM, iPhone or iPod touch, and a RileyLink) and a computer to build the app.\n\n\nClick on the image below to watch a short \nIntroduction to Loop video\n and then read the rest of these FAQs pages. \n\n\n\n\nThis looks so hard. I don't know if I can do it!\n\u2301\n\n\nThat isn't a question, but I do have an answer. ;) Building Loop app is actually really quite simple. There are a lot of steps only because they are laid out into short segments so that you can take breaks if you want.\n\n\n\n\nEach step is designed to end at a natural stopping or resting point, in case you get interrupted or want to take a break.\n\n\nSome of the steps only take 5 minutes to finish...so don't be intimidated just by the number of steps.\n\n\nThe steps are listed in the order that you'd do each task. So start at step 1 and proceed forward.\n\n\nEach step ends with a \"next step\" link to guide you to the next steps you'll need to do. Just keep swimming onto the next little step or take a break and come back later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne step at a time...\n\n\nDon't look at the whole build process at once...that's overwhelming. Instead view it as several smaller tasks to be accomplished and work one step at a time. Start at Step 1 and just read slowly and follow the screenshots. Don't skip steps or skip paragraphs.\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I get stuck?\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you get stuck, there are several things that can help:\n\n\n\n\nScroll back up in the directions and see if you maybe missed a step accidentally. Might even be that you missed a paragraph.\n\n\nCheck and compare your screen's display with what the screenshots are highlighting. Does your screen seem similar? Or does yours have an error message? If you have an error message, see if it helps guide you to the problem.\n\n\nIf you just get stumped, post in \nLooped Group (Facebook)\n or \nZulipchat\n and ask for help. Lots of people standing by to help each other. If you have a screenshot of where you are stuck and what part of the directions you are on, that will help a lot.\n\n\n\n\nSo, I build the app and then I'm done?\n\u2301\n\n\nNope...we wouldn't just leave you dangling like that. There's also an important walk-thru for how to set up your app for the first time. The new displays and settings are all explained in the \"Set up App\" section of this website. Check it out and follow along with each page step-by-step, just like you did for building. This way you'll learn valuable tips along the way too.

            "text": "General Loop FAQs\n\u2301\n\n\nWelcome to LoopDocs - a place for all things Frequently Asked.\n\n\nWhat is Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nClick on the image below to watch a short \nIntroduction to Loop video\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do I need to Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop has both hardware and software requirements. In general, to use Loop you need to have seven components.\n\n\n\n\nCompatible insulin pump: \nMedtronic or Omnipod\n\n\nCompatible CGM\n\n\nRileyLink\n\n\nCompatible iPhone/iPod Touch\n\n\nApple computer running Mojave macOS 10.14.3 or later\n\n\nXcode (a free Apple application)\n\n\nApple Developer Membership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I download Loop from the App store?\n\u2301\n\n\nNo. Loop is not available for download. You must build your own Loop app. Loop app will not be available in the Apple App store because that would be distribution of a medical device, and we are not in that \"business\".  You can build yourself, but we are not distributors.\n\n\nDon't worry though, building your Loop app is actually quite easy and that's what these docs are all about. The harder part will be having the patience to read all the documents before you start. New Loop users are so excited to get started that they skip reading all the great info that these docs contain. So, as you begin the build...please include time to read the documents that follow what happens AFTER you successfully build your Loop app.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, these docs have a nice search feature in the dark blue top menu bar that may help you find your answers pretty quickly too.\n\n\nCan I use an android phone for Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nNo, this is purely iPhone or iPod touch.\n\n\nDo I have to be \"tech-smart\" to build Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nNo. You do not need any experience in code or computers to build Loop. If you have already owned an Apple computer and iPhone, you already have the required level of experience. Beyond that, simply read the directions slowly and diligently...all the information you will need are in these documents.\n\n\nOften times the non-tech people do better than the tech people in building Loop. Why? Because the non-tech people take the time to read slowly and look at the screenshots in the directions. The tech people often skim read and miss sentences...which then leads to build errors that have to be retraced and fixed.\n\n\nIs there a cheat sheet for a school nurse to use?\n\u2301\n\n\nSure, you can give this one a try. \nSchool nurse's cheat sheet download\n\n\nHow long does it take to build Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nThe answer is varied, but a few hours from start to finish, depending on where you are starting and how comfortable you are with your computer.\n\n\nIf you'd rather break it up into several shorter bits of effort, the \nBuild App\n section is divided into convenient stopping points with Time Estimates for each step. You can do one or more steps depending on what kind of time you have available.\n\n\nDoes Loop cost money?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, there are some costs, beyond the obvious costs of owning a pump and CGM.\n\n\nThe \nRileyLink kit\n costs $150. This is a one-time cost and many people still have their original RileyLinks from nearly 3 years ago running just fine. I highly recommend purchasing two RileyLinks when financially feasible, to have one as a backup in case of accidental damage.\n\n\nThe Apple Developer License can be done for free, however, you will have to rebuild your Loop app every 7 days. That could get very tedious. The $99 annual Apple Developer program enrollment is an excellent investment.\n\n\nThere are no other costs, ongoing or initial, to use Loop.\n\n\nDo I need to own my own Apple computer?\n\u2301\n\n\nYou don't have to own your own Apple computer, but you do need to at least borrow one. It would be really good to have longer term ability to borrow that computer again for \nupdating Loop\n later, when needed.\n\n\nIf you are borrowing an Apple computer, you should ask the person to (1) update to Mojave and (2) \ndownload Xcode for free\n before you get together to build your Loop app. The updates and download of Xcode can take a couple hours depending on the person's internet speed...so best to do those steps well ahead of time to save trouble.\n\n\nCan I use a PC or Windows computer to build?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, you can...sort of. There is a hacked way of installing macOS on a Windows computer called \"Virtual Machine\". \nThis link\n may provide some helpful information for that if you want to learn more...but it's up to you and Google if you hit a road block. This Virtual Machine method will not work on PCs that have AMD processors either, so double check your computer before to confirm you don't have an old AMD processor. These docs do not provide troubleshooting tips for Virtual Machine installation or use.\n\n\nHow often do I need to get on the computer for Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nThe short answer is (1) when you first build and (2) once per year minimum after that. (If you decide to use a free Apple Developer Account, you will need to get on the computer every 7 days.)\n\n\nThe longer answer is that Loop code is updated periodically to include new features and bug fixes. When those updates are released, you'll need access to an Apple computer again to update your Loop app.  Loop updates are not available through the iPhone's app store...instead you do the app update yourself with \nupdate instructions here\n. In general, probably a few times a year there are updates to Loop released that you'd want to take the time to install.\n\n\nWill I need to build a new Loop if I switch between Medtronic and Omnipod?\n\u2301\n\n\nNo. Loop will have the option to move between different pump types from within the same Loop app. You'll simply use the \"Switch from Omnipods\" or \"Delete Pump\" options to move to the other kind of pump.\n\n\nCan I use someone else's Apple Developer account for my Loop build?\n\u2301\n\n\nTechnically, yes...however there are major drawbacks. The person's developer account can only be \"linked\" to a limited number of build computers. So one person \"loaning out\" their developer license to a lot of people will quickly exceed the number of allowed computers. In those cases, that person will be told they need to revoke the certificates on some computers (essentially dropping old ones to make room for new ones). When they do that, they may have forgotten about your Loop app on your computer. When they revoke your computer's certificate (and they can do that without you knowing through their developer portal), your Loop app will immediately stop working and not even open.\n\n\nYour Loop app will also die immediately if their developer account is not renewed or expires. Your Loop updates will also not be able to be built unless that person maintains the developer license agreement updates.\n\n\nMoral of the story, out of all the ways to save money...borrowing someone's developer account is not a good place to save money. You could find yourself unexpectedly without a Loop app without notice.\n\n\nCan I use MY Apple Developer account to build for others?\n\u2301\n\n\nTechnically yes...however, there are reasons this is discouraged. When you build for others, you must be careful to not unintentionally revoke the signing certificate that had been used for other people's apps (see note in FAQ above). You also need to let the people know that the MAXIMUM their app will last is 12 months. It will need to be rebuilt no matter what every 12 months.\n\n\nBut the biggest issue with building for others is that they may be left without a decent method of getting Loop updates. There are a lot of new Loopers on Omnipod system and their apps will likely need updating on a regular basis over the first year. Unless you plan on meeting with that person regularly to update their app, you could leave them on an old app that doesn't work as well as the new versions.\n\n\nHow can I find a compatible pump? supplies?\n\u2301\n\n\nThere is a \nwhole page with detailed information about Medtronic pumps\n; how to find them, how to find supplies, and assessing whether your Medtronic pump is compatible. Please check out that page for more info.\n\n\nWith the addition of Omnipod support, you can also now use Omnipod suppliers the way you'd normally source them.\n\n\nCan I pay someone else to do this?\n\u2301\n\n\nNOOOO...you really need to figure this out yourself. This is an automated insulin delivery system and you really need to know how to build and operate this yourself.\n\n\nWhat if I lose my RileyLink?\n\u2301\n\n\nFor Medtronic users, you simply go back to old school pump use until you get a new RileyLink. You can either let your temp basal finish by itself (30 minutes or less) or cancel the temp basal on the pump's menu. For bolusing, you'd go back to using the pump's bolus commands. When you get a RileyLink (either finding your old one or getting your backup RileyLink out) and Loop running again, you'll want to do one thing. Enter in any carbs to Loop that you may have eaten in the recent past that could still be affecting blood glucose. While Loop will read whatever insulin deliveries had happened while the RileyLink was missing, it will not read any carbs you entered into the pump...so make sure to add those to Loop and backdate them to the time they were eaten. That will help make the transition smoother to Looping again.\n\n\nFor Pod users, your Pod will finish any currently running temporary basal rate (maximum of 30 minutes) and then revert back to your scheduled basal rate. Without a RileyLink, you will not be able to affect any Pod use other than normal basals. No temp basals, suspends, or boluses will be possible, similar to if you were to lose your PDM. If you have a backup RileyLink, you can simply connect to the new RileyLink on the same Loop app and it will work with the existing pod session. If you don't have a backup RileyLink, you'll have to remove the pod and start a new pod paired with your PDM until you get a new RileyLink.\n\n\nWhat if I lose or get a new iPhone?\n\u2301\n\n\nWhen you get a new iPhone, Loop will need to be built onto that new iPhone in the same way that you built on your old iPhone. Loop will not restore from any iCloud or iTunes backups, so make sure you plan on finding an Apple computer to rebuild on before you plan on Looping with the new iPhone.\n\n\nWhat about other pumps? When will they Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nHey now...let's be grateful for what we have first. The ability to use Loop is the result of tremendous amounts of effort, time, and sacrifice by volunteers. Cracking the pumps for Loop use is a large undertaking. If and when another set of people spend a large amount of time figuring out other pumps, then they could conceivably be added to Loop. But, you don't need to let us know that you'd love to see more pumps compatible with Loop. So would we. There is just an awful lot of work that needs to happen and it is not easy nor quick.\n\n\nTandem pumps are not Loop compatible.\nAnimas pumps are not Loop compatible.\nDASH pods are not Loop compatible.\nAnd those all likely won't be compatible anytime in the future.\n\n\nCan I have more than one Loop app on a phone?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, technically possible. You can have multiple Loop apps built onto the same iPhone. However, having multiple Loop apps on a single phone may lead to unexpected conflicts that can negatively affect your Loop's ability to stay green (keep looping). Additionally, your Pod will only work on one Loop app at a time anyways. So for smooth looping, just keep one Loop app on any phone for looping use. \n\n\nWill I be able to Loop on a plane? Or in the mountains?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes. Loop does not require internet or cell coverage to work. So long as the Loop user has Bluetooth turned on on the iPhone (or iPod touch), then the Dexcom and RileyLink will still be able to do their work with Loop and your pump/Pod.",

When you get a RileyLink (either finding your old one or getting your backup RileyLink out) and Loop running again, you'll want to do one thing. Enter in any carbs to Loop that you may have eaten in the recent past that could still be affecting blood glucose. While Loop will read whatever insulin deliveries had happened while the RileyLink was missing, it will not read any carbs you entered into the pump...so make sure to add those to Loop and backdate them to the time they were eaten. That will help make the transition smoother to Looping again.  For Pod users, your Pod will finish any currently running temporary basal rate (maximum of 30 minutes) and then revert back to your scheduled basal rate. Without a RileyLink, you will not be able to affect any Pod use other than normal basals. No temp basals, suspends, or boluses will be possible, similar to if you were to lose your PDM. If you have a backup RileyLink, you can simply connect to the new RileyLink on the same Loop app and it will work with the existing pod session.

The newer DASH pods are not compatible with DIY Loop. Tidepool has begun a process to bring \nDIY Loop through FDA approval\n and Insulet has been announced as the \nfirst pump partner for that project\n.

They will pair with only one device at a time for safety reasons...so a pod is either paired with a PDM or your Loop app on your iPhone. In other words, your PDM can stay in the diabetes closet while you are Looping. You cannot use the PDM for a pod that has been activated with Loop. That doesn't mean you should get rid of your PDM. Instead, keep it for backup situations if you lose your phone. See below for what to do if you lose your phone or RileyLink. \n\n\nCan I cancel a temp basal Loop sets? How about a bolus?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, you can cancel a temp basal or a bolus in progress. There is a \"suspend delivery\" command that is easy to access by tapping on the \npod age icon in your Heads Up Display, upper right area\n. Suspending insulin delivery will cancel any running temp basal or bolus in progress. The suspend command will run indefinitely. A banner notification will be displayed on the Loop main screen while insulin delivery is suspended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin will remain suspended until the user either clicks on the \"Tap to Resume\" command from Loop's main screen or the \"resume delivery\" command accessed by tapping the pod age icon. Once insulin delivery is resumed, you will be resumed at your scheduled basal rate. If a bolus was interrupted, the bolus will not resume. If you don't turn on open loop mode, within 5 minutes of resuming insulin delivery, your Loop should resume automatic temp basal adjustments.\n\n\nCan I prime or set my own temp basal on Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nNo. Loop does not allow you to pick your own temp basal rate or prime insulin in. \n\n\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you would like to specify an exact temp basal rate of your own, you would need to (1) change your scheduled basal rate for the time(s) that you'd like a temp basal rate to run, and (2) suspend/resume insulin delivery (in order to cancel any currently running temp basal that Loop has running) and then (3) turn the slider so that you are running in \"open loop\" mode for the duration of the time you want to use that specific basal rate. \n\n\nWhat if I lose my phone or RileyLink?\n\u2301\n\n\nFor pod users, your pod will finish any currently running temporary basal rate and then revert back to your scheduled basal rate. Without a phone or RileyLink however, you will not be able to affect any pod use; no basal change, suspend, cancel, or bolus. To do anything other than let basals continue, you will need to take action depending on the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLost RileyLink only: You can replace your missing RileyLink with one from your backup supplies. No problem to switch out to a different Rileylink mid-pod session. If you don't have a backup RileyLink to use, then you will need to remove the pod and put on a new pod paired with your PDM until you can get a new RileyLink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLost iPhone only: You will need to remove the pod and put on a new pod paired with your PDM until you can get a new phone and Loop app built onto it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLost both RileyLink and phone: You're having a really bad day. You'll need a hug and follow the same directions as if you lost the phone as shown in the bullet above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there an increase in pod failures on Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nIn the early stages of development, there were. Thankfully to the hard work of Pete Schwamb and others, pod failure rate is now no longer increased compared to typical pod use with a PDM.\n\n\nWhat do I do if a pod fails to pair?\n\u2301\n\n\nThe most common time of pod errors on Loop will be during the pairing process. If you get a pod that is failing to pair, please see \nthis page\n for steps on how to fix the failure and recover before you lose the pod.\n\n\nWhat do you do to stop a screaming pod?\n\u2301\n\n\nScreaming pods can be silenced by carrying a paperclip. Simply put the paperclip in the small hole that is on the bottom (the side opposite where the cannula is) of the pod as shown. Push the paperclip in until you hear a little click, that click is breaking the circuit that lets the audible scream go.",

In the course of updating, you may be wondering about the different branches, what the differences are, and such...so let's try to answer some of those questions as best we can.\n\n\nWhat are branches?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, there are a lot of \"branches\" in Loop talk but the concept is simple. I'll use an analogy to help. Basically, they are all slightly different versions of Loop...kind of like different edits of the same book.\n\n\nTo really understand what branches are, we should probably explain a little more about Loop's code and how development works.  You can watch of video explanation of this process \nhere\n.\n\n\nLoop developers own an account in GitHub called \nLoopKit\n.  Within that account, the developers have several \"repositories\" that support Loop in particular. A repository is like a book...let's think of it like a cookbook for now. Within the LoopKit account, there are repositories for Loop itself, LoopDocs, and various other supporting \"frameworks\" that are helper repositories for Loop to build correctly. For example, Loop's repo has a lot of the info about the app itself; the outward facing things that you interact with. How information is put to you and taken in from you...that's in Loop repository code. But, there's more than just a user interface for Loop. Loop has to do a lot of complex work like Bluetooth communications, algorithm math, pump communications, etc. The Loop app has help from frameworks to do those other parts. CGMBLEkit for some of the transmitter parts of Loop, RileyLink_ios for the pump managers (talking to the pumps and decoding their information), LoopKit for the algorithm about carbs and insulin curves, etc.\n\n\nWhen you build Loop, in the background, Loop pulls those other frameworks (7 in total) into the build process using \"Carthage\".  Carthage is like a personal shopper. You give it a shopping list (the cartfile in Loop code is that shopping list) and it goes and fetches that for you during the build process. Sometimes your computer has an old shopping list...and that can cause build errors. Hence the \"carthage update\" fix in the Build Errors page...that command updates the shopping list to get the right versions of those frameworks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyways...so now you know about the general structure of Loop and LoopKit in Github. Now we can discuss Loop itself a little deeper.\n\n\nSo let's imagine Loop as a cookbook. The developers are the authors/chefs of the recipes (code) in the cookbook. The authors spend countless hours testing new recipes, taste testing, documenting improvements. They send the drafts to the editor, who makes suggestions and eventually the cookbook is finalized. There are no grammar issues, no typos, the photos are beautiful and the recipes are yummy. They publish the book and you see a gorgeous final product on the shelves. That is called a \"release\" and it is the master branch. This book has been well-tested and is super stable. Every time you cook with those recipes, you know exactly what you're getting and lots of people have had a chance before you to make sure that it all tastes good. Master branch is stable and tested.\n\n\nBut then...the chefs/developers go on a trip. They are inspired by new cuisine and want to add new recipes to the old cookbook. (Things like omnipod support and overrides are new \"recipes\" that were developed since the last master release, for example.) But, the process for developing a recipe is arduous. Lots of trial and error involved. Lots of tweaking ingredients (code). The editors try out the new recipes and offer feedback (similar to the \nIssues List in GitHub\n). While the recipes are being developed, they have a version of the old cookbook that gets marked up...edited in pencil a lot. Scribbles and notes in the side. Revisions happen frequently, because that's what testing new recipes is all about. These marked-up versions of the cookbook are called \"dev\" branch. Short for \"development\" branch. Like the name sounds...this is where new developments are happening, new recipes and tweaks. \n\n\nAfter much testing and tweaking, eventually the recipes get the flavors right (bugs in code are squashed) and enough people have provided feedback and careful observations of results...that the book goes to the publishing house for the next printing. The cookbook is republished with an updated edition number and new recipes are highlighted. When this happens in Loop, Loop's master branch is updated with the new features coming from dev (aka, \"dev branch is merged into master branch\"). When that happens, master branch gets another \"release\" version (you can see release history \nhere\n) and for that one day...dev and master are exactly the same. They stay the same until the Loop developers start working on the next batch of improvements, could be the next hour even or days later, but the process begins again. The developers will start editing the code again and dropping those edits in dev branch for further development.\n\n\nWhat happened to Omnipod-testing branch?\n\u2301\n\n\nOmnipod Loop development testing (not talking about the actual hacking work that preceded that) was done by a smaller group of people privately for months and months before public release of the omnipod-testing branch. This smaller group of people (several dozen) were actively watching their Omnipod Loops and capturing bug reports. There was a lot of work put in by the testers and Pete Schwamb (Loop Developer) to get the code fairly stable and reliable. \n\n\nWhen the code got to a stable, reliable state and was ready for a larger audience, omnipod-testing branch was made available as a \"public testing\" branch. This branch was pretty well-tested prior to public release, but not necessarily going to be perfect for everyone right away. There were expectations that some user-interface requests might be asked for after having a wider audience of users. \n\n\nAlso, omnipod-testing branch was not going to undergo a lot of active revisions to it when it was released. The intent was to keep it as a fairly known, unchanged product for people rather than a constantly changing code set...that way if people noted a bug, it would be a more \"known\" code base to work to debug.\n\n\nOmnipod-testing branch has served its purpose as an initial platform to test Pod looping. It has been officially retired now and is no longer needed. Omnipod support has been folded into the normal master and dev branches now.  Thank you, omnipod-testing branch...you served us well. Happy retirement.\n\n\nLoop v2.0\n\u2301\n\n\nOn December 31, 2019, Loop released Loop v2.0 (also said as \"Loop updated Master branch\"). This means that the cookbook from dev branch (to use our earlier analogy) was merged into master. On December 31st, master and dev branches were identical.\n\n\nFrom that date forward though, dev branch will start to work on its new recipes again. Dev branch will start to diverge from master branch with untested changes and development of new code. Dev branch may start to have some bugs and regressions as a result of the coming/going of code changes that will happen without much announcement or discussion.\n\n\nSo, most all users should now start building with master branch again...you will be getting the latest Loop release everytime you build with Loop master branch. That branch will stay in the same stable condition it has been for awhile now. Only use dev branch if you are interested in actively testing new code and have the ability to track/document bugs.\n\n\nWhat's new in Loop v2.0?\n\u2301\n\n\nThis is definitely a popular question and comes in a few forms...\n\n\nWhat's new in Loop v2.0?\nWhat is the difference between Loop v2.0 and dev branch?\nShould I update if I use dev branch now?\n\n\nThe question about what differences someone will notice between their existing Loop app and the new release...well I can only answer that if I knew which version/branch you are currently using (AND what date you built on if you are using dev branch). Because dev branch changes so often, the version someone is using from October 2019 won't necessarily be the same as the version someone built in November 2019.\n\n\nSo, I'll make a highlights reel compared to the last release and you can check it over to see if any of these seem \"new\" to you based on the version of Loop you have been using. They are listed roughly in reverse order of when they were merged into dev, so the higher up on the list, the greater the chance is that you haven't seen the feature yet.\n\n\nUploading of BGs to Nightscout\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop v2.0 has an option to upload your BG data to Nightscout directly. It is a new slider under the CGM configuration section for Dexcom users. After you add your CGM transmitter ID, go back into the CGM info and you'll see a new slider called \"Upload Readings.\"  Technically, Loop's dev branch had that feature for a hot minute before Loop v2.0 was released...but for almost everyone this will be a brand new feature they haven't had before. This feature can help if/when Dexcom's Share servers ever go through another large outage like we had before. If that happens, you can turn on the \"Upload Readings\" switch and your CGM data will now be in Nightscout even without Share servers working properly. Good practice would be to temporarily disable your Share bridge in Nightscout while Loop is responsible for CGM uploading so that you don't get duplicate data. You can disable Share bridge by logging into your Heroku account, going to the Settings tab, clicking on \"reveal config vars\" and then deleting the word \"bridge\" from the ENABLE line.\n\n\nA fix for settings loss\n\u2301\n\n\niOS 13 brought about a quirky little bug where you could suddenly lose settings in Loop. But, it wasn't just limited to Loop, sometimes people lost Dexcom app settings too. The issue is most common when the phone goes through a power cycle, but it has happened at other times, too. There's a fix for that new bug in Loop now...so that's a good reason to update. (If you encounter that bug before you have a chance to update your Loop app, simply restart the Loop app and your settings should reappear.)\n\n\nSpin for Watch Bolus\n\u2301\n\n\nTo prevent an accidental bolus from your Watch app, don't let your kids hold your watch. Just kidding, we've added an even better option. There is a new \"spin\" to confirm the bolus after you press the bolus button. You'll see a graphic like below on the watch face. As you spin the digital crown, the two triangles will begin to merge. Once they merge, the bolus is confirmed through a little haptic and a white checkmark will appear on the watch screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch recommended bolus\n\u2301\n\n\nA common code customization is also now no longer needed. Many people used to edit Loop code to have the Watch app provide 100% of the recommended bolus as the auto-filled quantity in the bolus field (default used to be 75%). Loop now offers the 100% auto-filled recommendation, no code customization needed now.\n\n\nRecent carbs list on Watch\n\u2301\n\n\nYou can review the recent carb entries on your Apple Watch now. Simply swipe left to see the blood glucose graph screen on your watch. Scroll down with the digital crown to the \"active carbs\" row beneath the graph, and tap that row. You can see the list of recent carb entries. \n\n\nFix for Medtronic x15 \"bolus may have failed\" message\n\u2301\n\n\nA lot of Medtronic x15 users received \"bolus may have failed\" messages after each bolus. That issue has been fixed and a patched version of Loop is no longer needed. All good!\n\n\nConfirmation beeps expanded\n\u2301\n\n\nConfirmation beeps have been expanded based on user feedback...we heard parents and school nurses really appreciate hearing a beep for not just boluses, but also for suspend/resume commands and editing basal schedule (so you are sure it saved properly). So, confirmation beeps are now for boluses, suspend/resume, and basal schedule edit saves.\n\n\nRead Pod Status added\n\u2301\n\n\nThere's a new command in the RileyLink menu for \"Read Pod Status\" that is analogous to the existing command for Medtronic users. You can query your Pod for its current status info using that command.\n\n\nBug fixes generally\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are a lot of niggly little bug fixes too which were merged in the last couple weeks. The temp basal timestamp for Medtronic Loop (and for older Omnipod Loops, too) had a bug that when Loop reverted to scheduled basals, the timestamp on the HUD's temp basal icon would switch back to the time the Loop was launched (instead of the time the scheduled basal was started again). There are also some new code improvements for handling uncerain boluses for Pod  Also, there are improvements to handle how Loop marks Pod suspend commands that are initiated by users while an active temp basal is in progress.\n\n\nUser interface improvements\n\u2301\n\n\nYou'll notice dashed lines in the HUD for the CGM value if the CGM data goes older than 15 min (that way you don't accidentally miss the fact that your CGM has failed). The API Secret is hidden after it is saved in Loop Settings now, and if you accidentally leave a trailing slash on the Nightscout URL...Loop will ignore it.  The bolus progress row is new to master branch now, although many of you have been accustomed to that visual in dev branch for awhile now. The \"Scenarios\" screen that would sometimes appear when a phone was shaken is also disabled by default now. The Issue Report has more information about your Loop app's build date and version so that you can more easily track its build history.\n\n\nCommon build error squashed\n\u2301\n\n\nOne common build error was caused if there was a space in the Loop folder name after downloading. This problem has been fixed and you will no longer get build errors if you have a space in your Loop folder name.  Ahhhhh! I love it!!!\n\n\nNightscout profile uploading\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop will upload your basal schedule, ISFs, carb ratios, and override presets from Loop settings to your Nightscout profile. If you ever lose your phone and need to setup Loop brand new...your settings will be easy to find in Nightscout now.\n\n\nNew languages\n\u2301\n\n\nJapanese, Danish, Swedish, Vietnamese, Finnish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Polish, and Romanian languages were added to the regional translations for Loop. There are definitely some missing strings that will still need touchups...we will get those fixed up in Loop v2.1 if you all \nhelp report those when you see them\n. Thanks!!\n\n\nNon-linear carb model\n\u2301\n\n\nAll branches (master and dev) now use a \"non-linear\" carb model, so let's give some info about the change.\n\n\nPreviously, the carb model Loop used had a linear absorption predicted with dynamic carbs adjustments. What this means is that food absorption was modeled as a flat, even effect (like the straight grey graph that you'll see in the \nInsulin Counteraction Effects chart\n after you added a carb entry. But looking at large groups of meals' datasets (and supported by personal, anecdotal experiences), food really has a bit more of a non-linear absorption. Meaning, we usually see more of a food impact up-front than the old carb model in Loop predicted.\n\n\nWhat did that mismatch mean for us if the model predicts a linear absorption, but the meal actually behaves differently? \n\n\n\n\nBolusing: You've probably seen smaller upfront boluses for meals than you would have preferred. This is because the insulin was predicted to over-power the linear (slower) carb model soon after a bolus is given.\n\n\nEarly low temp basals: You've also probably seen a tendency to have early zero basal or low basals set by Loop for the first 30-60 minutes after a meal bolus if you don't have a significant blood glucose spike immediately after the carb entry. This might have been even more obvious for those of you who are regularly waiting to eat after a bolus, too.\n\n\n\n\nWith a non-linear absorption model, the carb absorption will more closely match observed blood glucose impacts we've seen after meals. And when the model is more closely matching actual experience, that means the predicted blood glucose curves will do a better job at providing more upfront bolus and not having the tendency to have overly conservative temp basals soon after a meal.\n\n\nWhat should you expect?\n Like the description above, you'll likely see more complete bolus recommendations and less low temping after a bolus. With that in mind, if you've made adjustments to your Loop habits or settings to overcome those issues previously, you may want to undo those habits. Like if you shortened carb absorption times to help get larger boluses upfront, you may want to go back to standard times. Keep an eye on things and you should adjust as needed. \n\n\nWhat if you want to go back to the old model?\n You will have to edit a line in LoopKit's LoopKit code \nhere\n to use \n.linear\n if you wanted to go back to the old carb model. If you want to read more about the model, please check out the \nZulipchat thread here\n. But realize that the code edit for changing models would be easiest done using a \nLoopWorkspace\n because the edit is in one of the frameworks that Loop uses (rather than Loop code itself), so this is one of those instances where you will have to do some work to learn how to use a LoopWorkspace properly.\n\n\nOverrides\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop v2.0 marks the first time Loop master branch has overrides included. Additionally, this release moves overrides setup from the configurations area of Loop settings to the workout icon in the Loop toolbar. There has also been bug squashing in dev branch for overrides over the recent past, so updating is a good idea even if you already have overrides on your current build. Want to learn more about overrides? Read about them \nhere\n.\n\n\nRetrospective Correction always on\n\u2301\n\n\nRetrospective correction used to be an optional toggle in the algorithm. It is now on by default all the time. It is an important part of the algorithm (helps Loop look at how good/bad its recent prediction curve has been vs reality), and leaving it on made sense anyways.\n\n\nOmnipod support\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, most of you are already using Omnipod with your Loop...but this is the first time that Loop master branch supports Omnipod users. Please update if you have been using Omnipod-testing branch especially...it's time to get all the bug fixes that we've done in Loop.\n\n\nDark mode support\n\u2301\n\n\niOS 13 brought dark mode for application developers, and Loop's developer was all over that. We now have a wickedly cool dark mode Loop for those who prefer the dark side.\n\n\nISF and correction range guardrails and UI change\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop v2.0 also brings about the first time master branch has the useful scroll wheel to set values of ISF and correction range. This helps mitigate an old bug where backwards entered correction range values would crash Loop app. Also less prone to fat-finger mistakes on entry.\n\n\nSimulator pump and CGM\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you don't have compatible gear yet and just want to test Loop app, the new ability to add a simulated pump and/or CGM is a great new feature. \n\n\nNew style of Dexcom transmitters supported\n\u2301\n\n\nDexcom launched a new style of transmitters this summer. The new transmitters took some work by Loop developer (PETE! YEAH!) to get them working in offline Looping, but the fix was pushed into all branches shortly thereafter in August 2019. If you haven't updated your Loop since August 2019 and use a Dexcom G6, you should update now.\n\n\nHow can I stay current with what's going on in the branches?\n\u2301\n\n\nLike we said earlier, master branch won't really be changing much. You don't really need to watch that one for changes.\n\n\nBut, dev branch is a constantly shifting, moving place. If you choose to come into a dev branch build...you need to be aware that is what dev does...moves, shakes, changes, and will update code frequently and unannounced in the traditional sense that most users in Looped group or Instagram would see. Developers are not helped by people being in a dev branch if those users are mistakenly thinking of it as a stable master branch with lots of detailed docs to go with it. People should only use a dev branch build if they EDUCATE themselves on the expectations and how to properly manage dev information and updates. People using dev branch should also have regular access to a computer to be able to rebuild quickly if a new bug/fix is identified. \n\n\nIf you choose to use a dev build, you can stay abreast of developments in a number of ways...but they will all require you to do some legwork and keep yourself informed. This is not a situation where you should expect a fancy Loopdocs page updated regularly with current \"dev updates\"...that's just not the way dev branch works.\n\n\nWatch the Loop Repo and Issues list\n\u2301\n\n\nFirst, subscribe to the Loop repo's Issues list by \"watching\" the \nLoop repo\n. You can choose to watch the repo so that you get emails when new Issues are reported. This is a good way to find out if there's other people reporting odd behavior that you are wondering about. If you use dev and wonder about something you are seeing in Loop, you can check \nIssues list\n to see if others are noticing the same. If so, you can help by capturing information and reporting it. Not super helpful to just say \"yeah, me too...\" but better if you can attach screenshots, Issue Reports from Loop settings, and a thorough description of the problem you are seeing. Be a part of the solution by thoughtfully providing information to help debug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Zulipchat channels\n\u2301\n\n\nSecond, use \nZulipchat\n forums for Loop. This forum has several \"streams\" of conversations depending on interest. I highly recommend following the #github channel if you are wanting to watch for code changes. Code changes are called \"commits\" in GitHub. The #github channel will have an automated post whenever a new commit is made and it will give a brief line description of the commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also go directly to the commit history for each of the branches if you'd like.\n\n\nLoop master branch commit history\n\n\nLoop dev branch commit history\n\n\nIf you click on the commit, you can see exactly what changes to the code were made. It's an interesting learning experience. In red are the code that is old, in green is the updated code. The line numbers and file names of the edited code are also there to help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't expect many of you would understand exactly what the edits mean, or how the new code might function...but I bring up the topic of commit history so that you can use that to realize just how often dev is updated. Go ahead and look at the number and frequency of commits in that dev branch...that is why there is no way someone is going to keep a \"loopdocs\" of dev changes. It's just too much a moving target.\n\n\nKeep checking Looped group\n\u2301\n\n\nThird, keep watching Looped group. Major concerns/issues are brought up there...so no harm in scrolling through and seeing what's going on there.\n\n\nLoopDashboard.org\n\u2301\n\n\nYou can always check out the \nLoopDashboard\n  which summarize all the github activities in Loops 7 different repositories for dev and master branches. Here you can always see the latest \"news\" and  the history of Loop. \n\n\nOn the first page of loopdashboard you can see all the activities in one list, but you can also go to other pages and see more details about commits, issues and pull requests. There are also stats about who is doing the pull requests and commits.\n\nThe dashboard is updated every 12 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecome familiar with your data sources\n\u2301\n\n\nAnother useful thing if you'll be on dev branches undergoing a lot of active change...know how Loop works and where to look for additional information about what you are seeing. For example, if you see an IOB value that looks odd, you should know to look at the insulin deliveries are stored in Health app. Knowing to pull an Issue Report when you see a problem so you can provide that if asked. Knowing \nhow to capture debugging logs if the developers ask for that kind of info\n is also a good skill. \n\n\nWhat is expected in the future?\n\u2301\n\n\nRoughly speaking...right now (December 31st):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster: we know that there will need to be cleanup of the new translations. There were lots of new phrases and development with a lot of new languages, as well. Master (and dev) branch will be updated with fixes for the translations. When those translation fixes are done, there will be a Loop v2.1 released.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDev: Dev branch's future development is best tracked by watching and reviewing \npull requests in GitHub\n. This is the list where code changes are initially proposed and discussed.",

From that date forward though, dev branch will start to work on its new recipes again. Dev branch will start to diverge from master branch with untested changes and development of new code. Dev branch may start to have some bugs and regressions as a result of the coming/going of code changes that will happen without much announcement or discussion.  So, most all users should now start building with master branch again...you will be getting the latest Loop release everytime you build with Loop master branch.

Because dev branch changes so often, the version someone is using from October 2019 won't necessarily be the same as the version someone built in November 2019.  So, I'll make a highlights reel compared to the last release and you can check it over to see if any of these seem \"new\" to you based on the version of Loop you have been using.

This feature can help if/when Dexcom's Share servers ever go through another large outage like we had before. If that happens, you can turn on the \"Upload Readings\" switch and your CGM data will now be in Nightscout even without Share servers working properly. Good practice would be to temporarily disable your Share bridge in Nightscout while Loop is responsible for CGM uploading so that you don't get duplicate data.

            "text": "All branches (master and dev) now use a \"non-linear\" carb model, so let's give some info about the change.  Previously, the carb model Loop used had a linear absorption predicted with dynamic carbs adjustments. What this means is that food absorption was modeled as a flat, even effect (like the straight grey graph that you'll see in the  Insulin Counteraction Effects chart  after you added a carb entry. But looking at large groups of meals' datasets (and supported by personal, anecdotal experiences), food really has a bit more of a non-linear absorption. Meaning, we usually see more of a food impact up-front than the old carb model in Loop predicted.  What did that mismatch mean for us if the model predicts a linear absorption, but the meal actually behaves differently?    Bolusing: You've probably seen smaller upfront boluses for meals than you would have preferred. This is because the insulin was predicted to over-power the linear (slower) carb model soon after a bolus is given.  Early low temp basals: You've also probably seen a tendency to have early zero basal or low basals set by Loop for the first 30-60 minutes after a meal bolus if you don't have a significant blood glucose spike immediately after the carb entry. This might have been even more obvious for those of you who are regularly waiting to eat after a bolus, too.   With a non-linear absorption model, the carb absorption will more closely match observed blood glucose impacts we've seen after meals. And when the model is more closely matching actual experience, that means the predicted blood glucose curves will do a better job at providing more upfront bolus and not having the tendency to have overly conservative temp basals soon after a meal.  What should you expect?  Like the description above, you'll likely see more complete bolus recommendations and less low temping after a bolus. With that in mind, if you've made adjustments to your Loop habits or settings to overcome those issues previously, you may want to undo those habits. Like if you shortened carb absorption times to help get larger boluses upfront, you may want to go back to standard times. Keep an eye on things and you should adjust as needed.   What if you want to go back to the old model?  You will have to edit a line in LoopKit's LoopKit code  here  to use  .linear  if you wanted to go back to the old carb model. If you want to read more about the model, please check out the  Zulipchat thread here . But realize that the code edit for changing models would be easiest done using a  LoopWorkspace  because the edit is in one of the frameworks that Loop uses (rather than Loop code itself), so this is one of those instances where you will have to do some work to learn how to use a LoopWorkspace properly.",

Rebuilding your Loop app is really quite easy...so a short read of these questions should help a lot.\n\n\nFirst, please take a minute to understand what the words mean.\n\n\n\"Updating Loop\" is the process of getting a new download of Loop's code and using that to update your Loop. You do this when you want to switch branches. You do this when you want to get fixes or new features from the same branch. The process doesn't care if you are moving from omnipod-testing -\n dev or jojo -\n dev or master -\n dev or any other combination. \n\n\nUpdating Loop is the same idea as what happens to your other apps on your iPhone when you update them from the App Store on the phone. A refreshed version of the same app appears on the phone, simply replacing-in-place the same Loop you were using with an updated version.\n\n\nWhere should I start when I want to update my Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nALWAYS start with the \nUpdate Loop page\n before any new build that you'd be doing.\n That page is important because it will offer information on the updates you need to do before building, as well as any late breaking things that might need to be considered.\n\n\nDo not simply build with your old downloaded folder from months ago. There is a high likelihood that your original code from awhile ago is outdated. Grab new code and you will get the version that has all the latest and greatest features and bug fixes.\n\n\nWhen do I have to update/rebuild?\n\u2301\n\n\nAbsolute minimum: 1 year from when you last built (paid account).\n\n\nGood idea minimum: If on dev branch, frequently. I've found valuable updates to dev branch at least once a week lately...but I'd say monthly minimum at least for dev right now. Master and omnipod-testing branch do not have changes frequently.\n\n\nIssue specific minimum: There are also times where you may need to update for \"hot-fixes\" to keep your Loop working when other things change. For example, the new style Dexcom transmitters changed their Bluetooth protocol. Loop's code was updated for the new transmitters so that offline looping can continue to work. If you don't update to get that fix, you will be forced to rely on internet-required looping because older versoin of Loop won't have the updated protocols.\n\n\nWill I have to delete my old Loop app?\n\u2301\n\n\nNo. Do not delete your old Loop. In fact, that is a bad idea as you will lose your currently paired pod and/or settings if you do that. So, don't delete (except for two situations below):\n\n\n\n\nYou broke it: There is a glitch in Loop where if you enter the target correction range backwards, then your Loop app will stop working. Correction range needs to be in minimum-maximum, for example 100-120 mg/dL. If you entered that as 120-100 mg/dL, Loop will not work during the time that backwards correction range is supposed to be active. In this case you would need to delete the app and rebuild.\n\n\nMoving from dev branch back down to jojo branch. The way the new dev branch is coded will require you to delete your dev build prior to going back jojo branch.\n\n\n\n\nDoes updating make a separate, second Loop app?\n\u2301\n\n\nNo. Loop is simply updated in-place, written right over the old version. \n\n\nThe only exception to this is if you update/build using a different developer signing team than your original Loop app was built with. The app's identity on your phone is defined by the developer team that you signed the app with. That team has a unique ID to identify the app. So, if you change that unique ID, your phone interprets that as a unique app as well...giving you two Loop apps on the phone. Therefore, if changing developer accounts...you will get a new Loop app, and you would need a new Pod. You'll need to transfer your settings manually to the new app and delete your old app.\n\n\nWill my settings be saved when I update?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes. That's why we don't delete the app. Your settings will be saved.\n\n\nWill my pod still work when I update?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes. So long as you use the same developer team as you originally built the app with before.\n\n\nHow can I confirm what version was installed?\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Loop's version is given at the top of the Loop settings page. Even better though, the new dev branch has very detailed info about the version of Loop you are using at the top of your Loop's Issue Report. This is a great new addition to help identify where, what, and when of your Loop version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I'm changing branches? Does that matter?\n\u2301\n\n\nDoes not matter. Moving between branches is an \"updating Loop\" action.

Rebuilding your Loop app is really quite easy...so a short read of these questions should help a lot.  First, please take a minute to understand what the words mean.  \"Updating Loop\" is the process of getting a new download of Loop's code and using that to update your Loop. You do this when you want to switch branches. You do this when you want to get fixes or new features from the same branch. The process doesn't care if you are moving from omnipod-testing -  dev or jojo -  dev or master -  dev or any other combination.   Updating Loop is the same idea as what happens to your other apps on your iPhone when you update them from the App Store on the phone. A refreshed version of the same app appears on the phone, simply replacing-in-place the same Loop you were using with an updated version.",

Issue specific minimum: There are also times where you may need to update for \"hot-fixes\" to keep your Loop working when other things change. For example, the new style Dexcom transmitters changed their Bluetooth protocol. Loop's code was updated for the new transmitters so that offline looping can continue to work. If you don't update to get that fix, you will be forced to rely on internet-required looping because older versoin of Loop won't have the updated protocols.",

To help answer these questions, this page will be here short term to help answer these FAQs.\n\n\nShould I update to iOS 13?\n\u2301\n\n\nThat is a question that you should answer separate from Loop considerations. New iOS releases often have bugs in them, so I tend to avoid updating my daughter's phone for a bit. Instead, I update my phone and test things out first. Dexcom's app could have problems even...who knows. But, I certainly want to get a chance to kick-the-tires (or watch other people kick tires) for a bit before I try new iOS releases. Once I see things are ok and working without major issues, then I'll update her phone's iOS. Plus, going backwards once you've updated is a pain and usually not possible shortly after the new version is released.\n\n\nAlso, I don't update iOS until I've had time to update my macOS and Xcode as well. Once you update iOS, you'll likely have to do matching updates to other Apple software for Loop building...so you might as well make sure you successfully update the other pieces so that everything is squared away.\n\n\nWill my Loop keep working if I don't update to iOS 13?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes. Your Loop app will work for one year after you built it (or until the developer team's enrollment/signing certificate expires, whichever comes first). So, if you don't update iOS...no big deal for your Loop app.\n\n\nWill my Loop keep working if I update to iOS 13?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes. We have not had one iOS update that has broken Loop apps already installed on the phone. I think we started Loop on iOS 9? Loop has worked through all the updates.\n\n\nDo I have to update my Loop if I change to iOS 13?\n\u2301\n\n\nNo. You don't have to. \n\n\nIs there a benefit to updating my Loop if I use iOS 13?\n\u2301\n\n\nNope. Unless you want to try dark mode which is in dev branch and being developed there...that's about the only thing that is iOS 13 specific in Loop.\n\n\nWhy is iOS update a big deal then?\n\u2301\n\n\nBecause iOS major releases (like going from iOS 12 to 13...where the whole number changes) involve updates to several major other Apple-related things. It's a cascade effect.\n\n\nIf you update iOS with a major release, then Xcode will need to update, too. Because Xcode will need the new command tools, Swift language updates, and simulators to be able to properly build for devices that have the new iOS.\n\n\nAnd then the cascade continues...that new Xcode will likely require a macOS update. And sometimes (as happened when Xcode 10 was released), the required update to macOS was also a major update (High Sierra to Mojave) that some computers couldn't do. They were \"unsupported\" by Apple and were aged-out. Luckily, the update to Xcode 11 does not involve aging out any computers this time. If you were running Xcode 10 already, you'll be able to update to Xcode 11 without fear that you'll be left out based on macOS age.\n\n\nSo, iOS updates are a big deal (for Loopers) because they involve needing to do some updates to be able to properly build Loop again the next time you want to. And people forget about updates. And then they forget about LoopDocs' page specifically to help with Updating your Loop app. And so they just blindly download and build like they did last time...unaware there were needed updates.\n\n\nIt's not so much about Loop when you update iOS...the issue is about what other things you need to update BEFORE you build Loop again and AFTER you update iOS.",

            "text": "RileyLink FAQs\n\u2301\n\n\nWhat is the RileyLink? Do I have to have one?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, RileyLink is a required part of Loop. The RileyLink is a little device that helps your iPhone and pump (or Omnipod...that's a pump, too) speak to each other. The RileyLink is a critical part of the Loop system because the pump needs communications in radio form, and the iPhone needs communications in Bluetooth form. RileyLink is like a translator and can speak both formats so that the pump and iPhone can loop together. RileyLink helps get information to/from your pump by radio communications, and to/from your iPhone using Bluetooth.\n\n\nWhere can I buy a RileyLink?\n\u2301\n\n\nRileyLinks are made in batch productions (meaning sometimes they can go on backorder as another production is in process) and are available at GetRileyLink.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to buy a RileyLink for Omnipods, click \nhere\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to buy a RileyLink for Loop-compatible Medtronic pumps, click \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I have to carry the RileyLink everywhere?\n\u2301\n\n\nThe short answer is yes. If you want your Loop to keep automatically adjusting basals and issuing commands to your pump, you will need the RileyLink so that these communications can happen. Put it in a purse, pocket, SPIbelt. Clip it to a backpack, belt, or bra...but please do bring it with you.\n\n\nWhat are some ideas for carrying the RileyLink?\n\u2301\n\n\nI'm shocked that this question comes up so often...but here's some ideas. Please do not post in Looped group or Zulipchat for more ideas. This horse has been well-beaten, so use the search function in Looped group to see the previous responses. But, here's some samples for those of you who won't use the search function. ;)\n\n\nPost 1\n\n\nPost 2\n\n\nPost 3\n\n\nPost 4\n\n\nHow far away can the RileyLink be?\n\u2301\n\n\nThat answer will depend, it is environmentally dependent. Generally speaking, RileyLink is solid about 10-12 feet away in most environments. In some situations, you could have RileyLink work fine even at 20+feet away. Other times, you may need to get RileyLink closer. What influences this distance? The biggest influences are (1) body-blocking and (2) \"noisy\" environments. The human body is a lot of water, and water is an excellent blocker of wireless communication.  So, sleeping on a pod and smothering it entirely with your body will possibly decrease the ability of RileyLink to communicate with the pod. Environments with a high concentration of wireless signals can also interfere with RileyLink's communications and make closer proximity a benefit. Where might those kinds of situations happen? Concerts, conferences, and sporting arenas are pretty prone to interference.\n\n\nWhat happens if I walk away from my RileyLink?\n\u2301\n\n\nWhile you are out of the communication range for your RileyLink, any running temp basal will keep going until it finishes (the longest temp basal that Loop sets are for 30 minutes duration...so within 30 minutes or less your pump would go back to your regularly scheduled basal). When you come back into range of your RileyLink, Loop will pick back up within 5-10 minutes without you needing to do anything.\n\n\nWhat are the differences between Medtronic and Omnipod RileyLinks?\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are two different types of RileyLink currently; the difference being the antenna is optimized for the pump you are using. Otherwise they are identical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the new antenna an \"upgrade\" in Loop performance?\n\u2301\n\n\nIt is a bit of a misnomer to think of the newer copper coil antenna as an \"upgrade\". It is only an upgrade if you want to pod Loop. The new antenna will actually decrease your range if you try to use it with a Medtronic Loop.  See the next FAQ for a more detailed description and chart.\n\n\nWhat will happen if you use a 916MHz antenna RileyLink with an Omnipod? Or vice versa?\n\u2301\n\n\nThe answer will first depend on exactly how old that RileyLink is and what firmware it has installed.\n\n\nBefore August 2018, RileyLinks had a firmware that works for only Medtronic pump communication. So, if you have the older firmware on a RileyLink, your pod will never pair in Loop using that RileyLink. The GetRileyLink site does offer a \nRileyLink firmware update service\n, if you want to update to the newer pod-usable firmware.\n\n\nRileyLinks produced after August 2018, include newer firmware that is needed for Omnipod pump communications as well. The newer firmware will say \nsubg_rfspy 2.2/ble_rfspy 2.0\n in the RileyLink menu, like below when paired in Loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming your has the newer RileyLink firmware, you can \ntechnically\n use that RileyLink with either pump on Loop. But, you will have significant frustrations with the short distances required between the pump/pod and RileyLink when using the \"wrong\" antenna. Even keeping RileyLink in the pocket on the opposite of where the POD is on your body can cause issues with the 916MHz antenna. With mismatched antenna/pump, the RileyLink needs to be very close and in clear line-of-sight to pump/pod, that it makes everyday living a bit hard. If you use the appropriate-antenna-for-your-pump RileyLink, the distances the pump/pod and RileyLink can tolerate from each other is much more \"real world\" friendly and stable.\n\n\nIn summary, definitely use the appropriate RileyLink with the antenna that matches your pump so that you are less frustrated. In a pinch, your old RileyLink might work as a backup, but you won't love it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you swap out the old antenna on a RileyLink?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, the antenna swap is not a hard swap if you just have basic soldering skills. The old antenna can be removed easily by reheating the solder. New 433MHz antennas and a cap can be found on \nGetRileyLink site\n. Tips: use flux and clean the antenna stub before soldering. Poorly DIY-soldered antennas can lead to a decreased range and frequent communication drops between Loop and the pods.\n\n\nHow long will my RileyLink go between charging?\n\u2301\n\n\nRileyLinks can go about 30-32 hours (more or less) on a single charge. There is no way to see the remaining charge level, so most people just get into the habit of charging overnight while they sleep. The actual time to fully recharge is about 1 or 2 hours; you'll know it is fully charged when the red light turns off. After a full charge, the red light will turn off and then periodically turn on for short times while it \"tops off\" while still on a charger.\n\n\nHow long will my RileyLink battery last?\n\u2301\n\n\nEventually, lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries will lose charging capacity and you would want to replace if you notice the battery not lasting the full day. We've been using our current battery for nearly 2 years without issue.\n\n\nHow can I tell how much charge my RileyLink has?\n\u2301\n\n\nYou can't. There is no charge level indicator. Just charge it nightly, and you won't have a problem. Full battery charge should last about 30-36 hours depending on battery health. Charging takes less than 2 hours.\n\n\nHow should I carry the RileyLink? Does it make a difference?\n\u2301\n\n\nIn general, you want to get in the habit of carrying RileyLink with you, yes. A pocket, carabiner, lanyard, SPIbelt...the options are endless. What you don't want to do is put the RileyLink in a blocking bag that has RFID blocking (some travel fanny packs have that). The distance that your RileyLink can be away from your pump will depend heavily on the environment you are in.\n\n\nIs RileyLink waterproof?\n\u2301\n\n\nNope. Nor is it sweat-proof. Be careful.\n\n\nWhat is the most common issue for RileyLink?\n\u2301\n\n\nPeople not \npushing the LiPo battery\n in all the way when they first assemble their RileyLink. It takes quite a bit of push to get the plug inserted far enough. If not secured well, Loop will have more frequent problems.\n\n\nCan I use more than one RileyLink at a time? Will it improve anything?\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, you can have two turned on, but it won't help anything really. Loop only uses one RileyLink at a time. If you have several RileyLinks turned on in Loop settings, your Loop will only look for another RileyLink after Loop fails for over 15 minutes on the original RileyLink. In my experience, it is rare that Loop would fail for more than 15 minutes and a second RileyLink would help in the same environment. If one RileyLink gets damaged though and you need to swap out to a second RileyLink, there are no issues with that. \n\n\nCan I run Loop without a RileyLink?\n\u2301\n\n\nNope.",

In some situations, you could have RileyLink work fine even at 20+feet away. Other times, you may need to get RileyLink closer. What influences this distance? The biggest influences are (1) body-blocking and (2) \"noisy\" environments. The human body is a lot of water, and water is an excellent blocker of wireless communication.  So, sleeping on a pod and smothering it entirely with your body will possibly decrease the ability of RileyLink to communicate with the pod. Environments with a high concentration of wireless signals can also interfere with RileyLink's communications and make closer proximity a benefit. Where might those kinds of situations happen? Concerts, conferences, and sporting arenas are pretty prone to interference.",

            "text": "The answer will first depend on exactly how old that RileyLink is and what firmware it has installed.  Before August 2018, RileyLinks had a firmware that works for only Medtronic pump communication. So, if you have the older firmware on a RileyLink, your pod will never pair in Loop using that RileyLink. The GetRileyLink site does offer a  RileyLink firmware update service , if you want to update to the newer pod-usable firmware.  RileyLinks produced after August 2018, include newer firmware that is needed for Omnipod pump communications as well. The newer firmware will say  subg_rfspy 2.2/ble_rfspy 2.0  in the RileyLink menu, like below when paired in Loop.     Assuming your has the newer RileyLink firmware, you can  technically  use that RileyLink with either pump on Loop. But, you will have significant frustrations with the short distances required between the pump/pod and RileyLink when using the \"wrong\" antenna. Even keeping RileyLink in the pocket on the opposite of where the POD is on your body can cause issues with the 916MHz antenna. With mismatched antenna/pump, the RileyLink needs to be very close and in clear line-of-sight to pump/pod, that it makes everyday living a bit hard. If you use the appropriate-antenna-for-your-pump RileyLink, the distances the pump/pod and RileyLink can tolerate from each other is much more \"real world\" friendly and stable.  In summary, definitely use the appropriate RileyLink with the antenna that matches your pump so that you are less frustrated. In a pinch, your old RileyLink might work as a backup, but you won't love it.",

There's no need to do anything special with regards to your CGM session when starting or ending Loop use.\n\n\nWhat do I do when sensor is in warm-up?\n\u2301\n\n\nWhile the CGM is in warm-up, Loop will return to your scheduled basal delivery (within 30 min or less). You won't get temp basal adjustments during the warm-up period. If you need to bolus during this time, you will need to do a finger check and enter the blood glucose value into Apple Health app manually if you'd like Loop to offer a bolus recommendation. Loop will read that value from the Health app to provide you a bolus recommendation. If you are really ambitious, some people do frequent (15 min or so) finger checks and enter those into Health during warmup. This could allow Loop to do a bit of looping during warmup, albeit on blood glucose values that are spread pretty far apart compared to normal.\n\n\nWhat do I do when I switch transmitters?\n\u2301\n\n\nWhen you change transmitters, you will need to update the transmitter ID in your Loop settings. This is pretty simple task. \n\n\nWhen you change transmitters, select the \nDelete CGM\n button at the very bottom of the CGM info page in Loop. Then you will select your Dexcom system again and add the new transmitter ID. You cannot just tap on your old transmitter ID to update it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't update your transmitter ID when you change active transmitters, your Loop will be forced to go to your Dexcom Share server to get your CGM data and will not work without cell or wifi connection. When Loop is using data from Dexcom Share servers, a small cloud will appear above the BG reading in Loop and should tip you off that maybe you forgot to update your transmitter ID.\n\n\nCan I use Libre sensors with a reader like Miao Miao?\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you want to use a Libre sensor you will need to modify Loop to accomplish that use. Loop code does not natively support that sensor, nor readers.\n\n\nCan I use Eversense?\n\u2301\n\n\nNope. Eversense does not write to Apple Health nor has the BT communications protocol been reverse engineered the way it has been done with Dexcom.  \n\n\nCan Loop read CGM data from Nightscout?\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop does not read CGM data from Nightscout. You would need to use a solution such as NightscoutShareServer and make changes to Loop code in order to do that. Please search the Looped group on Facebook for posts regarding that option, as it is not a part of standard Loop use and is a community-based modification. You will need to do your homework and research to make that happen. At this time, there is not an active version of a modified Loop that appears to support this option easily.\n\n\nCan Spike or Xdrip be used with Loop?\n\u2301\n\n\nSpike and Xdrip are not supported by Loop. You will need to implement community-based modifications to Loop in order to use those apps with Loop.

When you enter a meal in Loop and press the save button...those carbs are saved. Let me repeat: THOSE CARBS ARE SAVED...even if you cancel the bolus for them. This is an automated insulin delivery system and if it thinks you have carbs on board, it will try to give you appropriate insulin for those carbs. Most common new user mistake: enters a meal, saves the carbs, has a change of heart or gets confused, and cancels the bolus screen...thinking they've just canceled the entire meal entry. Then they enter in a new carb entry. AND NOW, when you go to bolus...you'll be bolusing for the meal you wanted AND the meal you are mistakenly thinking you had \"canceled\". You didn't cancel that carb entry though, you had only canceled the bolus...you didn't \"unsave\" the carbs. If you make a mistake or change your mind on a carb entry after you pressed save, then tap the green carb chart in Loop's main display and edit or delete that entry. CANCELING A BOLUS DOES NOT CANCEL THE CARB ENTRY THAT GOT YOU THERE. You must delete or edit a saved carb entry if you no longer want Loop to provide insulin for it.",

Most common new user mistake: enters a meal, saves the carbs, has a change of heart or gets confused, and cancels the bolus screen...thinking they've just canceled the entire meal entry. Then they enter in a new carb entry. AND NOW, when you go to bolus...you'll be bolusing for the meal you wanted AND the meal you are mistakenly thinking you had \"canceled\". You didn't cancel that carb entry though, you had only canceled the bolus...you didn't \"unsave\" the carbs. If you make a mistake or change your mind on a carb entry after you pressed save, then tap the green carb chart in Loop's main display and edit or delete that entry. CANCELING A BOLUS DOES NOT CANCEL THE CARB ENTRY THAT GOT YOU THERE. You must delete or edit a saved carb entry if you no longer want Loop to provide insulin for it.",

If you have a Medtronic 512 or 712, you could check out \nOpenAPS\n as that system supports the 512 and 712 models in addition to the other Loop-compatible Medtronic pumps. Neither of those systems currently support Omnipod for looping.\n\n\n\"Can I change the firmware of my Medtronic pump?\"\n Do you work at Medtronic with insider access to the secret tools and firmware versions to do that?

Congrats!\n\n\nExtra Details on Medtronic\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nThere are a number of Medtronic insulin pumps manufactured between 2006 \u2013 2012 which are Loop compatible.  Compatibility has two requirements; (1) pump model and (2) firmware.\n\n\nMedtronic Pump Model\n\u2301\n\n\nTo determine your pump model, look at the backside of your pump.  There should be a sticker on the underside of the pump.  On the right-hand side of the sticker, it says REF MMT-XXXXXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMMT ---\n Pump Manufacturer Model (MiniMed Medtronic)\n\n722 ---\n Pump Model Number\n\nNA ---\n Pump Region (NA=North America, CA=Canada/Australia, WW=Worldwide)\n\nS ---\n Pump Color (S=Smoke, L=Clear/Lucite, B=Blue, P=Pink/Purple)\n\n\n\n\nSome pumps may have an \u201cL\u201d or \u201cS\u201d or \"R\" before the pump region, e.g. a model number like MMT-722LNAS.  This does not affect Loop compatibility.\n\n\nMedtronic Pump Firmware\n\u2301\n\n\nA pump\u2019s firmware is the internal software that runs your pump.  Older Medtronic firmware allows Loop to act as a \u201cremote control\u201d to set temp basals and report back pump data.  Newer firmware disabled that \u201cremote control\u201d access and therefore cannot be used with these DIY closed-loop systems.  There is currently no ability to downgrade a pump\u2019s firmware or replace it with older firmware.  Before you buy a used pump, make sure you are getting one with compatible firmware.\n\n\n\n\nThe firmware on all 515/715 and 522/722 model Medtronic pumps are all compatible with Loop. You will only need to check the firmware version for 523/723 and 554/754 model Medtronic pumps.\n\n+ Medtronic 515 or 715 --\n any firmware\n\n+ Medtronic 522 or 722  --\n any firmware\n\n+ Medtronic 523 or 723 --\n firmware 2.4 or lower\n\n+ Medtronic Worldwide Veo 554 or 754 --\n firmware 2.6A or lower\n\n+ Medtronic Canadian/Australian Veo 554 or 754 --\n firmware 2.7A or lower\n\n\n\n\nTo find your pump\u2019s firmware you will need to power it on. If the pump has not been powered on for some time (i.e., has been in storage without a battery for a while), it will run through a start-up count and the firmware version will appear on the bottom right of the pump\u2019s screen.  Don\u2019t turn away, as the version number will only be displayed for a little while before the screen moves onto other information displays.  \n\n\nIf the pump has been active recently or has a reservoir installed, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress the \n button on your pump.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down with the \n button to the bottom of the status display.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the bottom line of the display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedtronic Pump Differences\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you are in the position of being able to shop around for different pump models, there are some slight differences between the Loop-compatible Medtronic pumps.\n\n\n500 vs 700\n:  The difference between the Medtronic 500 series and the 700 series pumps is the size of the insulin reservoirs.  The 500 series pumps use a 180 unit reservoir, and the 700 series pumps use a 300 unit reservoir (or smaller 180 unit reservoir, if you want).\n\n\nx15/x22 vs x23/x54\n:  The difference between the x15 and x22 pumps versus the x23 and x54 series pumps has only a few notable mentions:\n\n\n\n\nThe x23/x54 pumps will allow for smaller insulin deliveries in certain situations, if the smaller scroll rate is selected in the Bolus\nSetup\nScroll Rate menu.  \nLoop will have the insulin delivery automatically rounded by the pump to the units available in the pump model, and any smaller adjustments (to make up for the rounding) will be made through Loop\u2019s use of temp basals.  If you want the smaller increments of basal rates, you can still enter those values in Loop app's settings and Loop will use those values for the purposes of insulin delivery calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPump Model\n\n\nBasal increments\n\n\nBolus increments\n\n\nRange\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n515/715\nand\n522/722\n\n\n0.05\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n0.1\n\n\ndeliveries of less than 10 units\ngreater than 10 units\n\n\n\n\n\n\n523/723\nand\n554/754\n\n\n0.025\n0.05\n0.1\n\n\n0.025 \n0.05 \n0.1\n\n\nbetween 0.025 to 0.975 units\nbetween 1 to 9.95 units\ngreater than 10 units\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, because of the way Loop fetches information from the pump, the x23/x54 series of pumps are slightly better at conserving battery life through the use of the MySentry packets to collect information from the pump.  x22 pumps do not use MySentry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe x23/x54 series pumps are also faster at delivering boluses greater than 10 units.  On an x23 pump, a 13-unit bolus takes 5:00 minutes to complete.  On an x22 pump, a 13-unit bolus takes 8:40 minutes to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding a Medtronic pump\n\u2301\n\n\nFinding a compatible Medtronic pump is probably the most difficult part for most new Loopers.  Our suggestion:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk to friends in the diabetic community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk your endocrinologist.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk at a local JDRF chapter meeting if someone has an old backup pump they'd be willing to donate to you.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin diabetic supply groups on Facebook; both for-trade and for-sale groups.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Craigslist often and be willing to expand your search area to include larger cities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the \nHelpAround, NextDoor, OfferUp, and/or LetGo\n apps for pumps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch \nMedwow\n for used Medtronic pumps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedwow has been fairly frustrating for most people; poor response rate and high prices.  The most success appears to come from either one-on-one discussions with fellow diabetics/doctors or using apps (Craigslist, NextDoor, LetGo, HelpAround).  If you are using Craigslist, you may wish to use an app on your iPhone to make the searching easier.  There are apps to search multiple cities at once for your keywords and set up alerts.\n\n\n\n\nSafe Purchasing\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you choose to purchase from a remote or unknown seller, here are some tips for safe purchasing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse PayPal and purchase using the \"Goods and Services\" payment option. This costs nothing for the buyer, but the seller will lose 2.95% of the sale to PayPal fees. PayPal offers some protection for both buyer and seller in the event of fraud.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk for photos of the pump. Check to make sure the serial number of the pump on the backside matches the serial number of the pump showing in the display menu. Ask for a short video of the pump, or at least a photo of the pump turned on, so that you can see the pump's firmware and model number. Cracks and some wear on these pumps are expected. These pumps are not usually free of marks. Many people are successfully looping on pumps that have cracks and rub marks, but you may want to ask if you are concerned about any you see in photos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeware if the bottom of the reservoir/motor sleeve has the drive support cap pushed out, as shown \nhere\n. Those pumps will generally not work (or only work intermittently), however some people have successfully repaired those pumps as shown in that link. Just be aware that it should be checked in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepairs to cracks or missing bits of plastic on battery cap area and reservoir caps are possible and not very difficult in most situations. You can read more about how to repair those \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk for shipping that includes a tracking number. USPS Priority Mail's smallest box is a great option.  It's only $7.20 domestically in the US and includes tracking. Ask the seller to add a small bit of packing protection such as bubble wrap around the pump to keep it safe during shipping. Make sure you get a tracking number within a reasonable period of time after you have paid.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed flags that may indicate a scam:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsking for payment through \"friends and family\" on PayPal, especially if you don't know the person or have any solid references for them. Paying in that way offers you no buyer protection. It's just like giving the seller cash, so you had better trust the seller.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffering an \"almost new\" pump is a big red flag. These pumps should be at least 5-years-old by now. Do you really think a 5 year old pump should be unused and sitting in shrink wrap at this point? This seems highly suspicious. There are some out there, but they are very infrequent.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot able to provide new pictures of the pump when requested. Sure they posted some pictures with the ad, but what if they just downloaded them from other people's ads? The seller should be able to furnish a couple of \"new\" photos at your request. A good one to ask for is the battery and reservoir tops so you can see the condition of those.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPump Supplies\n\u2301\n\n\nMedtronic will not typically sell pump supplies directly to customers who have not previously purchased a registered Medtronic pump. Ask your insurance about purchasing pump supplies through a durable medical equipment (DME) provider. Typically, the DME provider will coordinate with your insurance and doctor's office to get the necessary insurance approval and prescriptions for the supplies. If you are brand new to Medtronic infusion sites, you may want to ask for help from friends to try a variety of infusion sets before purchasing a full 90-day supply of any type in particular.\n\n\nExtra Details on Omnipods\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nReminder and Disclaimer\n\n\nThrough the work of the DIY community, Insulet's Omnipod (Eros) system is now Loop compatible. Using Eros pods with Loop is not supported by Insulet. Do not call Insulet asking for help with your Loop build, setup, or operation.

All use of Libre sensors as continuous glucose monitors involves the use of third-party applications (Xdrip or Spike) and reader devices (BluCon or Miao Miao). Loop developers have not seen data demonstrating sufficient safeguards from those readers and applications to feel comfortable adding main line Loop integration for those devices. If you use a Libre sensor, you'll have to use a \"not-main line\" branch of Loop that someone (or yourself) has modified to allow for use with those sensors/applications.\n\n\n\"What about Eversense?\"\n Eversense's application does not integrate with Apple Health, nor has the communications protocols for Eversense been reverse engineered. Therefore, Eversense is not compatible with Loop use currently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA continuous glucose monitor (CGM) provides Loop with current blood glucose readings. These readings allow Loop to predict what the current glucose trend is, and predict future blood glucose based on carbohydrate input and your Loop settings. The following are the types of CGMs compatible with Loop. CGM readings are a required part of looping. If your Loop is unable to retrieve BG data, it will not be able to loop.\n\n\nDexcom G5 and G6 CGM \n\u2301\n\n\nDexcom G5 and G6 receives CGM data directly to the Dexcom app on your iPhone via Bluetooth. Neither of these two systems require the use of a stand-alone receiver. For Loop to function, you will need the Dexcom app running.\n\n\nDexcom G4 CGM with Share Receiver \n\u2301\n\n\nDexcom G4 Share system transmits CGM data from the transmitter to a Dexcom G4 Share Receiver. The receiver, in turn, connects to the Dexcom Share2 app on your iPhone via Bluetooth. The Share2 app uploads CGM data to the Dexcom servers.

Loop can read the Medtronic CGM data directly from the pump using the RileyLink.\n\n\nOffline Use\n\u2301\n\n\nOffline use means using Loop when there is no cell data or internet available. Loop does not require any special setup to operate offline. You will not need to do anything special if you go camping or find yourself out in the wilderness. For offline Loop use, the iPhone's Bluetooth still needs to be active; and for Dexcom users, the Share2, G5, or G6 app also still needs to be open (but don't have to be actively \"sharing\" to the internet). If you put your iPhone into Airplane mode, remember to turn Bluetooth back on to keep your Loop running.

When that happens, the Loop can pull directly from Dexcom Servers to get the data (assuming you have entered your Share account information in the Loop settings and have Share turned on). When Loop is operating in this mode, you will see a small cloud in the CGM reading in the Loop app. Operating in this mode requires a working internet or cell connection.\n\n\nCGMs not natively supported in Loop\n\u2301\n\n\nLibre (with BluCon or Miao Miao), Eversense, Medtronic Guardian sensors, etc.  Yes, there are other CGM systems available out there.

If you use Libre...you will need to seek out a modified Loop     FAQs   \"What about Libre sensors?\"  Libre sensors are not designed to be continuous glucose monitors. All use of Libre sensors as continuous glucose monitors involves the use of third-party applications (Xdrip or Spike) and reader devices (BluCon or Miao Miao). Loop developers have not seen data demonstrating sufficient safeguards from those readers and applications to feel comfortable adding main line Loop integration for those devices. If you use a Libre sensor, you'll have to use a \"not-main line\" branch of Loop that someone (or yourself) has modified to allow for use with those sensors/applications.  \"What about Eversense?\"  Eversense's application does not integrate with Apple Health, nor has the communications protocols for Eversense been reverse engineered. Therefore, Eversense is not compatible with Loop use currently.    A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) provides Loop with current blood glucose readings. These readings allow Loop to predict what the current glucose trend is, and predict future blood glucose based on carbohydrate input and your Loop settings. The following are the types of CGMs compatible with Loop. CGM readings are a required part of looping. If your Loop is unable to retrieve BG data, it will not be able to loop.",

Do I have to carry it with me?\"\n Good questions...answered \nhere\n.\n\n\n\"Why is it named RileyLink?\"\n Riley is the name of Pete Schwamb's daughter and he's the guy that created the RileyLink.\n\n\n\"Can I make my own RileyLink?\"\n Technically yes, however it is not an easy project. You'll need specialized tools and patience. If you want to explore doing that, I'd highly recommend checking out \nZulipchat\n from the other people who have done their own builds successfully over the last several years. Only 3 people have built their own RileyLinks so far...but I guess that technically means it is possible. The PCB files and software, with instructions on how to build your own hardware module can be found at the \nRileyLink Github repo\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is RileyLink\n\u2301\n\n\nThe RileyLink (RL) is an open-source hardware device that can bridge Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to 916MHz or 433MHz wireless communication. What does that mean to you? It means RileyLink is the communication highway between your insulin pump, CGM, and iPhone.\n\n\nLoop will not work without the RileyLink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder RileyLink\n\u2301\n\n\nThis is an easy step. You need to order a RileyLink from the \nGetRiley website\n. \n\n\nThere are two types of RileyLinks; \none for Omnipod\n users and \none for Medtronic\n users. Order the RileyLink specifically for the pump you'll be Looping with. \n\n\nAssemble RileyLink\n\u2301\n\n\nYour RL will come with the battery disconnected and the parts not already inside the case. It will be up to you to put the RL in the case and attach the battery.\n\n\nMake sure the lipo battery is well-plugged into the connection. Line up the little ridge appropriately, and push fairly firmly to get the connection tight.  Poor battery cable connection can make the Loop communications fail.  See photos below, for example.\n\n\n\n\nCommon new user errors\n\n\nThe most common two errors for new RL owners are (1) not fully pushing in the lipo battery cable connection and (2) failing to charge the RL. Compare your lipo battery cable with the photos; it takes a bit of oomph to push that plug fully in like the photos shown below. Remember to charge your RL each night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoose battery cable on left, Proper battery cable on right\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the board and the battery fit into the slim case fairly tightly as well.  Click on the image below to watch a helpful \nassembly video\n.\n\n\n\n\nExtra Details about RileyLink\n\u2301\n\n\nRadio communications\n\u2301\n\n\nThe RL communicates with the pump through radio frequency communications.  Numerous factors can influence how well those communications can function...interferences from other devices, temperature, physical blocking, etc.\n\n\nWhen your RL and pump are first paired, Loop performs a series of tests that you won't see...they are tuning tests. Basically, RL sends little test messages to the pump and waits for a response. The RL tries this same \"ping\" to the pump a range of various radio frequencies. The range of radio frequencies it tries is based on the pump you've told RL to expect (Omnipod, Medtronic NA/CA, or Medtronic WW).  RL will then record the radio frequencies that provided the strongest response and use that frequency for future pump communications.\n\n\nUsually this best frequency is pretty constant for any given pump+RL, but during temperature changes it may be that the best frequency is not the one currently set. In the event that RL has problems communicating with the pump, Loop has code built-in that will automatically tell the RL \"Hey, try that tuning pump thing again...maybe there's a better frequency we need to try.\" This retuning is started automatically if pump communications fail for 14 minutes (in other words, two looping cycles).\n\n\nBluetooth communications\n\u2301\n\n\nRL communicates with your iPhone and Loop app through Bluetooth (BT).  \n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\n\nBluetooth Troubleshooting\nIf your iPhone has BT issues, your Loop will have failures.  There have been reports of BT audio devices (such as BT pairings in your car or home audio BT speakers) interfering with the Loop.  If you are finding Loop failures frequently happening at a particular location, you may try to troubleshoot if there are BT problems in the area.\n\n\nYour BT signal strength can be seen in the Loop settings, under the RL menu, on the \nSignal Strength\n line. As you move closer and further away from your phone, you can watch that number dynamically change. This line is \nnot\n displaying the signal strength of your pump communications discussed above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLights\n\u2301\n\n\nRL has several lights that you may notice from time to time. There is no 'power' light. If you suspect that your RL is not being powered, try turning it off and on using the small sliding switch. You should see lights in the middle of the board flash when you do this.  If they flash, that means the board has power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed light: Charging light. The red light will remain on while RL is charging, and it will turn off when charging is complete. You may notice the red light turn on periodically even after charging is complete...it's just \"topping off\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen light: Bluetooth connection light. The green light will remain on while you have a BT connection with your iPhone.  If that green light fails to stay on, you should troubleshoot your BT connections. Try restarting BT on your iPhone and/or turning the RL off/on by its power switch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue light: Pump communications.  If you have an older firmware on your RL, some of the blue lights will flash periodically as it communicates with the pump. It's just letting you know that it is busy talking and collecting info. You will also see increased blue flashes if you have \"Enabled Diagnostic LEDs\" for MDT users that have the RLs with updated firmware (shipping since late August 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA solid blue light that consistently remains lit on the board could mean one of two things:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA temporary issue that can be resolved by rebooting the RL physically (turning the switch off/on), or\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn electrical short or damage to the board.  Sweat and moisture are most likely culprits, so try to keep case free from those environments. Don't keep RL in sports bras or waistband next to skin, for example, while exercising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your blue light remains on despite trying a restart, it is time to pull out your backup RL.\n\n\nCharging\n\u2301\n\n\nThe battery that comes with RL is not likely charged completely when it is shipped, so feel free to charge it up.  You'll need a \nmini-USB cable\n and \n0.5A USB charging power supply\n like your iPhone power supply.  RL takes about 2 hours to fully charge (the red light will turn off when fully charged, read note above about red light patterns) and should easily last at least a full day of constant Loop use.  Typically, it can go into the 30-hour range without any problems.  Most people charge their RL each night when they are sleeping.  You don't have to worry about leaving the RL plugged in \"too long\" for charging.  It will automatically stop charging the battery when it is fully charged.\n\n\nSince the best practice is to charge your RL overnight while you sleep, and the battery lasts safely over 24 hours, there is no battery level indicator for the RL.  The RL's charge level is not viewable on Nightscout, nor within the Loop app.  If you forget to charge your RL overnight, you can recharge it with a portable USB battery in a pinch.  A \nshort mini-USB cable\n could be a good addition to a small gear bag.\n\n\nRange\n\u2301\n\n\nThe range that your RL will function is \nheavily\n dependent on the environment that you are in. Most people wear the RL in a pocket or carry a belt holster during the day. The radio frequency communications will have a shorter range than the BT communications, therefore RL will do better closer to the pump rather than the iPhone if you are deciding on options for carrying gear. \n\n\nProblematic environments will be places like technical conferences, sports arenas, and other places where wireless communications are heavy and plenty.\n\n\nLipo Battery\n\u2301\n\n\nKeep your RL and lipo battery protected from damage.  Lipo batteries are unsafe when damaged or punctured, so the case is an important part of safe Looping. If your battery is damaged in some way, please disconnect it immediately, and dispose of it (they should be recycled). You can order new batteries on the \nGetRileyLink website\n\n\nRemoving Lipo Battery\n\u2301\n\n\nTo remove the lipo battery from the RL, please do so slowly and patiently. Work the battery connection side to side slowly to loosen it from the plug. Some people have reported success using small, curved needle-nose pliers such as hemostats. Others have used small flathead screwdrivers as shown in \nthis video\n.\n\n\n\n\nWaiting for RileyLink\n\u2301\n\n\nYes, waiting for RL to arrive is extremely difficult if they are backorder.  PLEASE be patient, since Loop CANNOT work without RL.\n\n\nIf you're really dying to do something while RL ships, you can proceed with finishing these build directions all the way through Step 14...but after that you'll have to wait for the RileyLink.  You can't properly enter any settings or pump info in Loop app without the RileyLink.\n\n\nNext Step: Enroll in Apple Developer Program\n\u2301\n\n\nNow you are ready to move onto Step 6 to \nenroll in the Apple Developer Program\n.",

The RL's charge level is not viewable on Nightscout, nor within the Loop app.  If you forget to charge your RL overnight, you can recharge it with a portable USB battery in a pinch.

Typically for the developer enrollment, use the Apple ID of the person who will be doing the Loop app building. \n\n\n\"How long does it take to have my Apple Development account active after I enroll?\"\n After you enroll, make sure you look for a confirmation email. Apple says it can take up to 24-48 hours to confirm and setup a new Apple developer account, however some people have had the process only take minutes. It can vary. One SURE way to make it take longer? Use a different credit card to pay for the Apple Developer account enrollment than is already associated with the Apple ID you'll be enrolling with. When you do that, I've heard Apple makes you send in a xerox copy of your driver's license and a bunch of other hassle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to build your own Loop app, you will need to use an Apple developer account.  You will have two options for an individual account; free or paid.\n\n\nFree Developer Account\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you decide to use a \nFREE\n developer account, here's what you need to know:\n\n\n\n\nLoop apps signed with a free developer team will expire after 7 days.  On the 7th day, your Loop app will simply turn white when you open it and then immediately close. To rebuild the Loop app, you will have to find a computer and rebuild the app onto your iPhone again. You cannot rebuild the app on day 5 (when it is convenient, for example)...hoping to reset the 7-day clock.  The app will still expire on the 7th day from when it was first signed and created.\n\n\nIf you decide to switch to a paid account after trying out the free account, you will need to rebuild your Loop app in order to sign it with the new paid account.\n\n\nYou will have to do an extra step during the build process to remove Siri and Apple Push capabilities in order to build with free accounts. Because free accounts do not have access to Apple Push notifications, you will also not be able to use remote overrides through Nightscout.\n\n\n\n\nPaid Developer Account\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you decide to use a \nPAID\n developer account, here's what you need to know:\n\n\n\n\nLoop apps signed with a paid developer team will last for a full year.\n\n\nThe paid developer account is $99 per year and is default set to auto-renew annually. You can change that selection in your developer account settings at any time.\n\n\nIf your household has multiple Loop users, only one developer account is needed.  That one developer account can be used to sign multiple Loop apps.\n\n\n\n\nSwitching from Free to Paid Memberships\n\u2301\n\n\nIn summary: This is no problem trying a free account first before you decide to buy a paid developer account. If you start with a free account, you'll build a Loop app (let's call it FreeLoop). When you switch to a paid account, you'll be building a totally new and separate Loop app onto your phone (let's call it PaidLoop). The two apps will look identical on your phone, but they will be functionally separate from each other...ideally you want to delete the FreeLoop app before using the PaidLoop app.\n\n\nPaidLoop will know nothing about the settings and information you had stored in FreeLoop, so you will need to re-enter all your settings (basal rates, ISF, carb ratios, etc.) and configurations into the new PaidLoop. It will also not connect or control any pods you are currently using with the old FreeLoop you had installed.\n\n\nSo, when switching from Free to Paid Loop builds...try to remember that you'll have the best luck by (1) timing it at pod change time and (2) take screenshots of your old app's settings so that you can enter them into the new app.\n\n\nEnrolling\n\u2301\n\n\nPaid account enrollment is all through Apple's Developer Program website.

Xcode is a pretty beefy-sized download...and needs even a little more space to properly unpack and install itself. Best to try to have about 20-25GB of free space on your hard drive before starting to be on the safe side. If you get low on free space, I've seen installation failures. You can check your free space by clicking on the \nAbout this Mac\n (like in Step 1) and clicking the \nStorage\n tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday is an easy one, but probably takes the longest of most of any of the steps in terms of time...only because the download takes a while. The good news is that you don't have to watch this. Instead, you can start the download and simply walk away for the rest of it.\n\n\nXcode is a free application for Apple computers. Xcode will turn the Loop \"raw\" code into an iOS application and install it onto your iPhone/iPod. \nMake sure you have updated your macOS AND checked the \nSoftware Updates\n button before proceeding...in other words, make sure you did Step 1's work.\n\n\nOpen your App Store in your computer and search for Xcode...you'll either be downloading it brand new or updating an existing installation. The minimum version you need will depend on the iOS your iPhone is running. The version number should be showing in the \"what's new\" description as shown in the image below. This is a big download, so don't expected this to be fast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo important facts\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum version of Xcode that you need is dependent on the version of iOS you have on the iPhone. The newer the version of iOS, the newer of Xcode you'll also need. \nThe most current version of iOS (14+) requires Xcode 12 and macOS 10.15.4 at a minimum\n \n\n\nThe newest Xcode version \nmay also require you to update your macOS version\n. If you have an old version of macOS, then the App Store will not show you that a newer version of Xcode is available. This can create confusion because your iOS could be requiring a newer Xcode, but the App Store won't show it as available. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do all the minimum versions relate to each other?\n\u2301\n\n\nMost often what happens is that people will update their iOS on the iPhones more often than they update their macOS or Xcode.  You know how it goes...you're tapping on your phone one day and it says there's a new version of iOS available for your phone. Want to update it now? Or be reminded of it later? Or maybe you even have the setting on your phone set to automatically install iOS updates.\n\n\nBecause the update looks so innocuous and we all lead busy lives, we forget that there might be consequences to iOS updates.\n\n\n\n\nLoop and iOS updates\n\n\nFor Loopers...the consequence to an iOS update is nothing immediate. Your Loop app won't die, it will keep humming along. \nBUT, before you \nupdate or rebuild\n your Loop app on that phone, you will likely need to update your macOS and Xcode applications because of the newer iOS.  And you will need to do the updates/checks in a certain order:\n\n1st: Check if your macOS has updates\n\n2nd: Check for an Xcode update.\n\n\n\n\nThe chart below is a helpful visual of the minimum versions you'll need based on your iOS. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmacOS: If you are running an iPhone with iOS 14, you need to make sure your macOS is 10.15.4 at a minimum as the first step.

Summary   After making sure your macOS is up-to-date for your iPhone's iOS (see the info below), download Xcode from your computer's App Store application.     FAQs   \"Why isn't my Xcode installing?\"  I can't see your computer to know exactly why...but the two most common reasons are (1) lack of internet connection or (2) not enough free space on the computer's hard drive. Xcode is a pretty beefy-sized download...and needs even a little more space to properly unpack and install itself. Best to try to have about 20-25GB of free space on your hard drive before starting to be on the safe side. If you get low on free space, I've seen installation failures. You can check your free space by clicking on the  About this Mac  (like in Step 1) and clicking the  Storage  tab.    Today is an easy one, but probably takes the longest of most of any of the steps in terms of time...only because the download takes a while. The good news is that you don't have to watch this. Instead, you can start the download and simply walk away for the rest of it.  Xcode is a free application for Apple computers. Xcode will turn the Loop \"raw\" code into an iOS application and install it onto your iPhone/iPod.  Make sure you have updated your macOS AND checked the  Software Updates  button before proceeding...in other words, make sure you did Step 1's work.  Open your App Store in your computer and search for Xcode...you'll either be downloading it brand new or updating an existing installation. The minimum version you need will depend on the iOS your iPhone is running. The version number should be showing in the \"what's new\" description as shown in the image below. This is a big download, so don't expected this to be fast.       Two important facts   The minimum version of Xcode that you need is dependent on the version of iOS you have on the iPhone. The newer the version of iOS, the newer of Xcode you'll also need.  The most current version of iOS (14+) requires Xcode 12 and macOS 10.15.4 at a minimum    The newest Xcode version  may also require you to update your macOS version . If you have an old version of macOS, then the App Store will not show you that a newer version of Xcode is available. This can create confusion because your iOS could be requiring a newer Xcode, but the App Store won't show it as available.",

You know how it goes...you're tapping on your phone one day and it says there's a new version of iOS available for your phone. Want to update it now? Or be reminded of it later? Or maybe you even have the setting on your phone set to automatically install iOS updates.  Because the update looks so innocuous and we all lead busy lives, we forget that there might be consequences to iOS updates.   Loop and iOS updates  For Loopers...the consequence to an iOS update is nothing immediate. Your Loop app won't die, it will keep humming along.  BUT, before you  update or rebuild  your Loop app on that phone, you will likely need to update your macOS and Xcode applications because of the newer iOS.  And you will need to do the updates/checks in a certain order: \n1st: Check if your macOS has updates \n2nd: Check for an Xcode update.   The chart below is a helpful visual of the minimum versions you'll need based on your iOS.     macOS: If you are running an iPhone with iOS 14, you need to make sure your macOS is 10.15.4 at a minimum as the first step. If you don't have the minimum version, go to  Step 1 Compatible Computer  and follow directions for updating your macOS.     Xcode: Now that your macOS is updated to 10.15.4 minimum, the App Store in your computer will have Xcode 12.0.1 (or newer) available for you to download/update.

Setting basals is a HUGE important step to setting yourself up for Loop success.\n\n\nInsulin Sensitivity Factor\n (sometimes called Correction Factor) is how much one unit of insulin will bring down your blood sugar. The higher the value of this setting, the more sensitive to insulin you are. An ISF of 30 means one unit of insulin brings your blood sugar down 30 mg/dL. You can test this setting after you get good basals set and tested. Simply bring yourself to a higher BG with a glucose tab or other small quick carbs. Wait until you see yourself plateau again at the higher BG, then make a correction. Wait 4-6 hours (again no food) and see where your correction lands your blood sugar. Divide the BG drop by the amount of correction insulin you delivered...that\u2019s your ISF. \n\n\nCarb Ratio\n is the amount of carbs covered by one unit of insulin.

This  lack of data  will cause a little friction with the health care industry; not good for your insurance records, not good for your endo to feel comfortable, and not good for you to know how your Loop use might be improved with settings tweaks.  So let's explore options for your Loop data. There are three great options for where your Loop data can be stored and retrieved:   Apple Health app  Nightscout  Tidepool   All of the options are free and easy to setup. Take some time to familiarize yourself with these options and setup your preferred system(s). Personally, I use all three for various aspects of my data's story to me...Nightscout being the most useful day-to-day as a remote caregiver of a young Looper.",

Avoid vague phrases and the word \"it\". Aim for details and specifics. Screenshots are gold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm worried I'll ask a stupid question\"\n Don't worry about that...instead just focus on asking a \nthorough\n question. A thorough question explains what you've already tried or read, has screenshots of what you are confused by, and any other details that you can provide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline groups\n\u2301\n\n\nThere's a whole wonderful community of people already Looping who willing to help you through the process. You can find them in two main areas; \nLooped group on Facebook\n and \nZulipchat\n.\n\n\nThese groups, as with Loop itself, are entirely driven by VOLUNTEERS. None of the people are paid to answer questions or spend time troubleshooting...they do it because they want to help others. Please decrease that support burden by doing some simple steps yourself before turning to others for help. Please click the image below to watch this video full of tips to make the most of your online resources.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n\u2301\n\n\nOne super valuable tool for posting to online groups is the ability to take screenshots of your issue and use them in your posts. On an Apple computer, simply press \nshift-command-4\n keys at the same time and a little crosshairs tool for taking screenshots will appear. Click-and-drag across the area you'd like to screenshot. When you let go of the button, the screenshot will be saved to your desktop with a file name starting with \"screenshot\". Use screenshots over cell phone images or words whenever possible...screenshots are higher resolution and easier to read.\n\n\nAdditionally, take a wider screenshot than you may initially think you need. Especially if you are posting asking for help with settings or Xcode build errors. Nightscout and Xcode have lots of valuable information off-to-the-side that many people dismiss, when really it can be valuable for troubleshooters.\n\n\nDescriptive Language\n\u2301\n\n\nDescriptive language doesn't mean the four-letter words that get you frowns at the cocktail parties. Instead, this phrase means to use the most accurate, detailed words that you can when asking for help. In summary, try to avoid the word \"it\" and instead use details and information to help fill in the story about why you're asking for help, what you've already tried, and what happened when you tried those things (including screenshots). Let's illustrate with a couple of examples.\n\n\nExample 1\n\u2301\n\n\nBad:\n \"It's not working.\" \n----makes me wonder what \"it\" is? What part of \"it\" isn't working exactly? The app? The BG control? The pump integration? Alarms? Bolusing? Their Dexcom?\n\n\nOk:\n \"My Loop app won't open.\" \n---- Ok, so now I know the Loop app itself seems to be the problem, but still don't know if this is a build error or an error that has happened after building. The solutions would be different potentially. \n\n\nBetter:\n \"My Loop app was working yesterday just fine, and now today it's not doing the things like I expect.\" \n----- Getting closer. Now I know this is not a build error and that it sounds like a more recent issue. I'm starting to narrow down the potential causes...this is about as much detail as it takes for me, as a volunteer, to consider to start helping. I might not have to ask 42 questions but instead only 4 questions now to find the remaining information for troubleshooting. But, if there were more details...I'd be more likely to wade in to help because more details saves me from questions.\n\n\nAwesome:\n \"My Loop app was working yesterday just fine. Around lunch time, I went into the settings screen and made some adjustments and ever since it just turns white and closes no matter what I try.\" \n---- DEFINITELY getting closer. Now I have a strong suspicion about where the bug is happening and can help with a couple links.\n\n\nGOLD MEDAL WORTHY:\n \"My Loop app was working yesterday just fine. Around lunch time, I went into the settings screen and made some adjustments to correction ranges. Ever since I did that, the app immediately turns white and shuts down. I have tried restarting my phone, but it has not fixed the problem. I tried searching the docs for 'loop closing' but didn't see results that matched my issue.\" \n----- This person is doing an outstanding job of describing the problem. Lots of good details. Has shown initiative to try to use the resources already. Throw in a screenshot, if it was appropriate, and this person will have done an excellent job of helping all of us help him/her.\n\n\nExample 2\n\u2301\n\n\nBad:\n \"My Loop app won't build.\" \n----- What step are you on? What kind of computer are you using? What macOS? What Xcode version? Have you built successfully before or is this new?\n\n\nOk:\n \"I'm trying to update my Loop app to the new omnipod-testing branch, and am getting a few errors that I don't understand.\" \n----- Wow, sure would be nice to know what those error messages are. Are they red or yellow? A screenshot sure would help here.\n\n\nBetter:\n \"I have a macOS Mojave 10.14.5 computer with Xcode 10.3. Downloaded Loop-omnipod-testing branch this morning and I'm getting some red errors about an exit code that I don't understand.\" \n----- Cool, now I don't have to ask if they updated their macOS like the directions say to do, and I can rule out Xcode being old. Still would be great to have screenshots so I can see the exact error message.\n\n\nAwesome:\n \"I have a macOS Mojave 10.14.5 computer with Xcode 10.3. Downloaded Loop-omnipod-testing branch this morning and I'm getting some red errors about an exit code that I don't understand. I've tried everything in the docs and nothing worked.\" \n---- While I'm super happy they \"tried everything\", I'm no closer to knowing what the exact error message is nor which \"stuff\" exactly they tried. \n\n\nGOLD MEDAL WORTHY:\n \"I have a macOS Mojave 10.14.5 computer with Xcode 10.3.

I tried searching the docs for \"exit code 645\" and didn't see any responses that helped. I tried the \"carthage update\" solution but got an error message during that too...here's the screenshot for that as well.\" \n---- OH BABY I love you. This is the kind of detail that will get you to an answer very fast.\n\n\nBe ok with links\n\u2301\n\n\nA lot of time, the answer to your question for help will be answered with a link. Please don't take offense to getting a quick link back to LoopDocs or LoopTips. This is most often because the question is already answered there and the person is simply saving time by not typing out what already exists elsewhere.  There's a ton of information between these two sites, so it can be easy to overlook something if you're not sure what to search for.\n\n\nIf you've searched the docs and read the info already, then please include that in your post. That way you don't get linked back to the same part you're already confused about. Plus, letting us know when these docs can be improved is very useful. \n\n\nNext Step: Download Loop Code\n\u2301\n\n\nNow you are ready to move onto Step 13 to \nDownload Loop Code\n.",

Just be patient...one of the build steps to take \nmuch\n longer than all the others. The build process does always end in a success or failure message, so just wait it out until you see one of those displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Loop project in Xcode\n\u2301\n\n\nGo to your Downloads folder, open your downloaded Loop code folder and double click on Loop.xcodeproj. If you downloaded dev branch, your folder would be named \nLoop-dev\n and similar for \nLoop-master\n download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA warning may appear asking if you really want to open it, click Open. Xcode will get itself organized, this may take a few minutes.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce Xcode has finished indexing, the Loop project's various folders and files will appear in the far left column. We are now going to make three important sets of clicks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst click: At the very top of all the folders and files listed, click on the blue \"Loop\". This will populate the middle part of the Xcode window with some information. \nIf a couple of little boxes appear saying \"The folder \u201cDerivedWatchAssets.xcassets\u201d doesn\u2019t exist.\"...just click the ok buttons and ignore those. They will come up a couple of times during your build if you are using dev branch right now...don't worry, won't be a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond (set of) clicks: Now click on the box in the middle screen to reveal the targets column underneath that box. The four targets we will sign in the upcoming steps are now easily viewable. Now also click on the Loop target like shown in the screenshot below. It will be highlighted in blue to let you know it is selected. Loop, Loop Status Extension, Watch App, and WatchApp Extension are the targets we are interested in later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird Click: With the Loop target selected, click on the \"Signing \n Capabilities\" up near the top of the screen. After you click on that, you should see a \"Signing\" section occupying the bulk of your middle window. If you are missing the \"Signing \n Capabilities\" section and didn't have to click somewhere else to see that part...that means you have missed updating to Xcode 11 from an older version of Xcode. Please go back and update Xcode now. Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect your iPhone to Computer\n\u2301\n\n\nConnect your iPhone via cable to the computer, select your iPhone from the very top of the drop-down list.  Your \niPhone\u2019s personal name\n should be at the top of the list. Don't accidentally select the generic iOS simulators listed below your iPhone's name.  \n\n\n\n\nHelpful Tips\n\n\n\n\nIf your iPhone has a lock enabled, Xcode will not be able to install Loop app once your phone locks during the build progress.  Please temporarily disable the lock until you finish building Loop app.  Go to your iPhone Settings \n Display \n Brightness \n Auto-Lock and set it to \nNever\n.  You can reset your lock once Loop is done building onto the phone. If you can't or don't want to set the auto-lock to never, then please remember to tap your phone screen periodically during the build process later to keep it \"awake\".\n\n\nIf this is the first time your iPhone has been plugged into this computer, you will need to open the iPhone and select \"Trust this Computer\" before your device will be useable in the menu selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Common Mistake\n\n\n\n\nThe most common mistake in this step is not selecting your actual phone as shown in the second screenshot below. The default list is just a name of general phone models under a subheading called \"iOS Simulators\"...don't be fooled by those. Your ACTUAL phone will be up above that list of all the various simulator phone models.  You may need to scroll to the top of the list in order to see it.  Make sure you select your actual phone, not just a simulator phone model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Four Targets\n\u2301\n\n\nOnce you select your device (your iPhone's name), we are ready to start signing the four targets. We will start with the Loop target, the first one on the target list.  Under the \"Signing\" area, select the dropdown menu where it currently says \"none\". Choose your team that you'd like to sign with. If you select a team name with (personal team), your app will expire after 7 days. If you select a team name without that (personal team), your app will last a full year.  If you never signed up for a free developer account, you will not have a (personal team) showing. Make sure you keep the \"automatically manage signing\" box checked above the team selection area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you choose your signing team, Xcode will automatically generate provisioning profiles and signing certificates.  If this is the first time you are building on this iPhone with this developer account, you may be prompted to register the device.  Simply click on the \"Register Device\" button to confirm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Developer Account Users: READ ME\n\n\nIf you are using a free developer account to sign your targets, you will need to do an extra step. As a free developer, you are restricted from building apps that have Siri or push notification capabilities built-in. Loop has both of these capabilities...so you will need to disable them before proceeding on with signing and building your app. The push notification capability is used for setting remote overrides; disabling it will not affect regular notifications (like ones for Loop not looping). Click on the small x next to the Siri and push notification lines located at the bottom of your Signing \n Capabilities page. You need to do this in both the Loop and WatchApp Extension targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA successfully signed target will have a provisioning profile and signing certificate similar to the screenshot below.  Click on each of the three remaining targets, and repeat the signing steps by choosing the same team name as you selected in the first target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Customizations\n\u2301\n\n\nNew Loop users\n: Customizations are not a required part of any Loop build. As you gain experience in how you use your Loop app, you may want to customize some of the features. You can always update your Loop app to add customizations at a later time. Really though, building with the standard, the default installation is JUST FINE.\n\n\nIf you want any custom configurations to your Loop or Loop Apple Watch apps, now is the time to make them before you finish with the last step of Loop installation on your iPhone. Follow the step-by-step instructions on the \nCode Customizations\n page. If you are a person familiar with Apple's Swift language, feel free to make your own customizations as well.\n\n\nWhen you've finished your customizations, come on back to this section and continue on with the rest of the build.\n\n\nPair your Apple Watch\n\u2301\n\n\nNew Apple Watch users\n: If you have an unopened Apple watch and want to use it with Loop, first pair the watch with the iPhone before continuing to the next steps.  If you get a new watch after building the Loop app, you'll need to redo your Loop build. (Don't worry, it's as easy as pressing play on your saved Loop project.)\n\n\nExisting Apple Watch users\n: Please update your watchOS prior to building the Loop app.  The current version of Loop requires watchOS 4.1 or newer.\n\n\nINTERMISSION\n\u2301\n\n\nSTOP STOP STOP\n\n\nYou guys...this is about safety.\n\n\nPeople keep ignoring this advice and I'm frankly a little stumped as to why. So, I'm moving this advice up in the process so that you don't ignore it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT WING THE SETUP\n\n\nI have warnings all over these instructions to \ncontinue to use these docs to finish setting up your app after it builds. DO NOT IGNORE THAT ADVICE. DO NOT ENTER ONE LOOP APP SETTING WITHOUT HAVING THE DOCS OPEN AND FOLLOWING ALONG AT THE SAME TIME.\n\n\n\n\nThe section in these docs called \"Set up App\" (See it? Look for it now...at the top of your webpage) needs to be used to input all the settings in your Loop app when it is done building. READ ALONG WITH THE DOCS to enter those settings. There are important safety tips and advice in there. And then after you finish setup, you need to read the \"Operate\" section...like BEFORE YOU OPERATE LOOP. Don't bolus for a meal, or enter a meal, until you've read through the Operate section. \n\n\nI'm worried you will fail to heed the advice about using the setup and operate sections. People have ignored it before. They skim read and think that's good enough. DO NOT BE LIKE THAT. Read each section. \n\n\nBUT, to mitigate the inevitable people who will ignore that advice....here's the two most important safety tips that I feel obliged to present out of order because (damn it), people will ignore my advice still.\n\n\n\n\nTOP TWO SAFETY MISTAKES YOU SHOULD AVOID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT ENTER SETTINGS YOU ARE UNSURE OF. If you don't know your settings or know what the terms mean, stop. Read the docs, all the settings entries are explained there. Ask your endo if you don't have established values for those settings. Don't just guess an ISF, carb ratio, basal rate, or maximum delivery limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT ENTER ACCIDENTAL DUPLICATE CARB ENTRIES. When you enter a meal in Loop and press the \nsave\n button...those carbs are saved. Let me repeat: THOSE CARBS ARE SAVED...even if you cancel the bolus for them. This is an automated insulin delivery system and if it thinks you have carbs on board, it will try to give you appropriate insulin for those carbs. Most common new user mistake: enters a meal, saves the carbs, has a change of heart or gets confused, and cancels the bolus screen...thinking they've just canceled the entire meal entry. Then they enter in a new carb entry. AND NOW, when you go to bolus...you'll be bolusing for the meal you wanted AND the meal you are mistakenly thinking you had \"canceled\". You didn't cancel that carb entry though, you had only canceled the bolus...you didn't \"unsave\" the carbs. If you make a mistake or change your mind on a carb entry after you pressed save, then tap the green carb chart in Loop's main display and edit or delete that entry. \nCANCELING A BOLUS DOES NOT CANCEL THE CARB ENTRY THAT GOT YOU THERE. You must delete or edit a saved carb entry if you no longer want Loop to provide insulin for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, so now that I've got your attention, you can continue on with the last step in building you app...but remember, we just pinky swore that you would use the setup and operate sections to finish this all? Don't break my heart, keep your promise.\n\n\nBuild Loop\n\u2301\n\n\nHave you signed the four targets? Are you all done with any customizations? Has your Apple watch been paired and updated? Is your iPhone unlocked and plugged into the computer?\n\n\nLet\u2019s finish the installation of the Loop app onto your iPhone. Double-check to make sure your iPhone's name is still selected and then press the \u201cbuild\u201d button to start Xcode on its way. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll see the progression of the build in the status window (top middle of Xcode). New builds can take about 40-60 minutes depending on the speed of the computer and the internet.  \nJust be patient.\n  The progress will get \"stuck\" on one step/task for a very long time, and then the others will fly by when that one slow step is done. Not every step is equal in duration. Do not give up on the build. \nXcode will ALWAYS tell you eventually that the build either succeeded or failed via a short (self-disappearing) pop-up message on the computer display. If you miss the message, you can look at the top of the Xcode window to see a \"Running Loop...\" (success) or \"Build Failed\" (failure) message where the step progress was previously counting down.\n  \n\n\n\n\nAre you the impatient type?\n\n\nIf you just simply can't bear the uncertainty of not seeing that things are progressing, you can take a peek \"under the hood\" and watch the individual build steps by clicking on the report navigator icon and then the build row at the top of the list. You can watch the slow list of scheme building while you wait.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst-time builders\n\n\nBe aware though! Sometime during your first ever build on a computer, be ready for a codesign/keychain access prompt that you will see part-way through the build process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis prompt above, when you see it, requires you to enter your computer password and then select \"Always Allow\". Normal behavior, this prompt will come up four times in a row even after you enter the correct password. In frustration, people think the prompt must be broken because it keeps reappearing and then people will press deny or cancel. \nDon't press deny.\n Keep entering your computer password and pressing the \"Always Allow\" button...as many times as it takes (four times to be exact; one for each target that Xcode is saving the password for). After four times of successful password entry, the build will keep proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I have you here...\n\n\nWhile I have you here, I'm going to give you a piece of Loop troubleshooting advice for once you start looping. This is a little out of order, but too many people miss this super simple \ntroubleshooting step when their Loop turns red\n. Try turning your RileyLink off/on at its physical switch on the side of the case. Carrying a paperclip on the keychain can help you access that recessed switch. The other useful troubleshooting step is to simply close the Loop app (upswipe in iPhone app selector) and reopen it. Wait 5 minutes after each of these steps and see if your issue resolves. It usually will. Don't forget to do these two simple steps to get back to a green loop.  For more red loop troubleshooting, you can check out \nthis page\n.\n\n\nAlso, be aware that there's a \ntroubleshooting page for Pod pairing\n issues, too. If you run into any issues during Pod pairing, PLEASE make sure to read \nthis page\n to save yourself from wasting Pods unnecessarily.\n\n\nOk, back to the building instructions.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Finished\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nFirst time building on a new device?\n\n\nIf this is the first time you have installed an app on your iPhone using your developer account, you may get a warning like below after a successful build. Don't worry, Loop usually installed just fine on the phone but needs you to do an extra step on the phone before Loop app can open. Just follow the directions shown in the warning for what you need to do on your iPhone. Go to Settings-\nGeneral-\nDevice Management (or profiles, Profiles \n Device Management on newer iOS) and enable trust for your Developer Account. If you are missing the Device Management/Profiles option in your iPhone settings, then head over to \nthis Build Error section\n to find the solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUILD SUCCEEDED\n\n\nCongrats! If the build is successful, you'll see the message or \"Running Loop...\" across the top of the Xcode window. Your brand new Loop app will have a screen open immediately on the iPhone asking about allowing Loop notifications and Health App access. \nAllow\n Loop to send you notifications. In the next screen that follows that, click on the \nTurn All Categories On\n line and then click \nAllow\n in the upper right corner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can unplug your phone from the computer now.\n And like we promised earlier, you will use the \nSetup App section of this website\n to keep proceeding safely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ: But what about those yellow alerts that remain in Xcode? Should I worry about them?\n\n\nIf you see yellow alerts after your build is done...those are not an issue. Whether your build succeeded or failed...the yellow warnings play no role in either outcome. Don't try to resolve them or fret about them. They mean nothing to the successful use of your Loop app.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUILD FAILED\n\n\nDon't despair. Build failures are pretty easily fixed. If you get a message that your build failed and see \nRED ERROR\n messages, just go to the \nBuild Errors\n page to find the steps to fix your build error based on the message displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\u2301\n\n\nIf your build failed, you need to proceed to the \nBuild Errors\n page to find the solution. Please head there to find the help you need.\n\n\nIf no build errors, you're done building your Loop app...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\n\u2301\n\n\nRemember your promise though? You still owe me that you will use the \nSetup App\n section of this website now to keep proceeding safely.",

If this is the first time you have installed an app on your iPhone using your developer account, you may get a warning like below after a successful build. Don't worry, Loop usually installed just fine on the phone but needs you to do an extra step on the phone before Loop app can open. Just follow the directions shown in the warning for what you need to do on your iPhone. Go to Settings- General- Device Management (or profiles, Profiles   Device Management on newer iOS) and enable trust for your Developer Account. If you are missing the Device Management/Profiles option in your iPhone settings, then head over to  this Build Error section  to find the solution.      BUILD SUCCEEDED  Congrats! If the build is successful, you'll see the message or \"Running Loop...\" across the top of the Xcode window. Your brand new Loop app will have a screen open immediately on the iPhone asking about allowing Loop notifications and Health App access.  Allow  Loop to send you notifications. In the next screen that follows that, click on the  Turn All Categories On  line and then click  Allow  in the upper right corner.      You can unplug your phone from the computer now.  And like we promised earlier, you will use the  Setup App section of this website  to keep proceeding safely.    FAQ: But what about those yellow alerts that remain in Xcode? Should I worry about them?  If you see yellow alerts after your build is done...those are not an issue. Whether your build succeeded or failed...the yellow warnings play no role in either outcome. Don't try to resolve them or fret about them. They mean nothing to the successful use of your Loop app.  \n     BUILD FAILED  Don't despair. Build failures are pretty easily fixed.

            "text": "Build Errors\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are two types of build errors that happen; they are yellow warnings and red alerts. You'll see the warnings and alerts in the left-hand column of the Xcode window.\n\n\nYellow warnings\n do not cause the build to fail, those are just warnings.  Occasionally, a Loop version may have some minor discrepancies that cause a yellow alert...ignore those. Do not try to do anything to fix those...leave them alone.\n\n\nRed error alerts\n \n will have to be resolved before you can successfully build the Loop app. The steps below explain how to resolve them based on the messages you are seeing.\n\n\nStart with the obvious error causes\n\u2301\n\n\nBefore you start trying to resolve your red errors...start with the most obvious things that can cause a red error message:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT USE BETA VERSIONS\n  If you are using an iOS beta version or an Xcode beta version, your Loop will not build. If you have Xcode beta, uninstall it and get regular Xcode. If you have iOS beta on your iPhone, you will need to restore your iPhone entirely. You can restore to either (1) the last non-beta backup version you saved or (2) restore as a new iPhone (default settings). Yes, deleting iOS beta is a pain...so don't install it in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you check for Xcode updates?\n Cannot emphasize this one enough...you should check for Xcode updates (and install them) before building. If you are updating your Loop app, you often have updated your iOS since the previous build. This may require a macOS update in order to have the App Store tell you there's an even newer Xcode available. So...check both macOS and then Xcode for updates!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you check your Apple developer account for new license agreement?\n Periodically, Apple will release a new developer license agreement that you need to sign before you can build new apps. You will get a build failure if there is a pending license agreement to sign. \nLogin to your Apple developer account\n to check if there's a new license agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you reboot your computer after updating Xcode?\n Yup...that was in the reminder on the page about updating your Loop app...did you ignore it? ;)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you get a fresh download of Loop code, don't just recycle an old download that you built with a long time ago?\n That old version may not be compatible with new iOS and new Xcode versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you are using a free developer account?\n Make sure you finished the \nremoval of Siri and Push Notification capabilities\n. And if you are using iOS 13.3.1 on your iphone, there's a known bug in Apple's programs right now that will not let you build Loop with a free developer account onto phones using 13.3.1...so until that gets resolved by Apple...sorry. Out of luck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst good step to 95% of all errors\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you have checked all those steps above and think you have a true build error...here's the best starting place that resolves 95% of all build errors. \n\n\n\n\nOpen your project in Xcode as normal. Then go to the Xcode menu at the top of the screen and find the \"Product\" menu item. Use the drop down selection for \"Clean Build Folder\" or press shift-command-K. Either will work the same.\n\n\nOpen the Terminal app on your computer.\n\n\nCopy and paste this command and press return: \nrm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.carthage.CarthageKit\n Note: you won't see any message back if the command runs successfully.\n\n\nCopy and paste this command and press return: \nrm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData\n Note: you won't see any message back if the command runs successfully.\n\n\nEnter the command \ncd ~/downloads/loop-master \n carthage update\n.  \nNOTE:  YOU MAY HAVE TO CHANGE THE COMMAND SLIGHTLY if your folder isn't named loop-master as shown in the command.\n  If your loop folder isn't named loop-master and instead is loop-dev or some other folder name...change the command to match your folder's actual name. Replace the \"loop-master\" with your folder's actual name. Carthage update will take about 15-25 minutes to run successfully.  A successful carthage update will look like the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to Xcode and now trying building your app again.\n\n\n\n\nIf the build fails again, look through the list below and see if you can match up your error message with one specific error messages listed in the later section of this page. If you really can't find your solution (PLEASE LOOK for it...you need to see the circled bits to know where to look perhaps. There's a section below to help you with finding the error message), then post for help. BUT, use the section below to post. WE CANNOT HELP without that info covered in the section. \n\n\nPosting for help\n\u2301\n\n\nSTOP!!  Read this section! Important!\n\n\nBefore you post in Zulipchat or Looped Group asking for help with build errors, \ndo your work first\n. The build errors listed below (and the obvious checks listed above) are very successful \nIF PEOPLE READ THIS PAGE\n. The volunteer group of people answering questions in Looped and Zulipchat would love to spend more time on improving Loop in other ways than answering build error questions that can be answered by using this page as a first step.\n\n\nTherefore, first use the error topics (listed in sections below) to try to resolve your build error yourself. Then, if you need to post for help because this page did not fix your problem, you'll need to include information with the post so we (the troubleshooters) know you read this page and where you are in your troubleshooting attempts\n\n\n\n\nMust include in your post\n\n\n\n\nThe version of Xcode you are using\n\n\nThe version of Loop you are building with\n\n\nThe version of iOS on your Loop iPhone\n\n\nSpecify if you are using a free or paid account, and if free...confirm you deleted Siri and Push Notification capabilities\n\n\nConfirm you are not using an Xcode beta or iOS beta version (so we don't have to ask, actually type \"I am not using beta versions\"...this will save a lot of time and hassle)\n\n\nScreenshots of your WHOLE Xcode window and/or Terminal window showing your error and any messages you've seen while working through the build errors/solutions.  NOT phone pics.  See below for instructions on how to do this.\n\n\nState which fixes from the below list that you have already tried AND post the screenshots of the results of those fix attempts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful tip: Shift-Command-4-spacebar will give you a screenshot tool that you can use to click on the Xcode window to grab a screenshot. The screenshot will save to your desktop so you can include it in your post. Phone photos of your computer screen won't likely be of sufficient clarity to read the needed information and often cuts off valuable information that we look for in the various parts of the Xcode window. Use the whole Xcode window's screenshot when posting for help.\n\n\nFind your error message(s)\n\u2301\n\n\nTo begin fixing the error, use the Report Navigator view to find your error message. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key is to (1) \nREAD THE ERROR MESSAGE\n and then (2) \nFIND YOUR MESSAGE IN ONE OF THE TOPICS BELOW\n.\n\n\nHere's a super tip: Merely seeing the \"exit code\" in Xcode is not enough information to discern what error is causing your build to fail - some exit codes can have multiple causes. Look at the detailed message to really help guide your search for the matching solution.\n\n\nNotice how in the screenshots in the topics below, there are red circles highlighting certain error messages? Read your error messages similar to where those red circles are in the screenshots below. Once you find your error message (hint: not \"exit code\"), you can either:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake the error message from your Xcode screen and use LoopDoc's search function to enter in some of that phrase to bring up the appropriate solution topic, or\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake the error message from your Xcode screen and read through EACH OF THE TOPICS BELOW. Check each of the red circles to see if you have a match. Kind of like a matching puzzle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you see \"Invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)\" in your error message, use the search tool in LoopDocs with simply \"invalid active\". You will get a couple of links and one is the Command Line Tools fix for that error message. Click on the link and you'll find your solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific Error Messages\n\u2301\n\n\nCould not locate device support files\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you see an error message that says \"Could not locate device support files.\" That messages is telling you that your iOS on the phone requires you to get a newer version of Xcode to be able to build Loop onto that phone. Update your Xcode version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOften people get confused at this point because their App Store may be telling them \"no updates available\" for Xcode, so they incorrectly assume that they have the most current Xcode.  \n\n\nInstead, realize that the App Store only shows the updates available for your macOS version. If your macOS version falls behind...then the App Store will not show you Xcode versions that are incompatible with your older macOS. In other words if you are have Mojave macOS, you won't see newer versions of Xcode in the App Store that would require you to have the newer Catalina macOS. \n\n\nHow are the versions all related? Use the figure below to determine your minimum.  \n\n\n(Source for the figure below is \nwikipedia\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using iOS 13.4.x on your iPhone, you'll need Catalina macOS 10.15.x at a minimum to be able to see Xcode 11.4.x in the App Store for download. Therefore, update to Catalina and then update to Xcode 11.4.x to resolve your build error message about \"device support logs missing\". \n\n\nNo such module 'LoopKit' or similar message\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you see a \nCartfile failure\n and several other red errors (in particular saying there is \"no such module 'LoopKit'\"), double click on the Cartfile error message.  If it says that the build failed in one of the schemes, as shown in the screenshot below, then re-run the fix listed above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper License Update\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: \"\nThe Apple Developer Program License Agreement has been updated,  In order to access certain membership resources, you must accept the latest license agreement.\n\"\n\n\nSolution: You'll need to log onto your developer account at \ndeveloper.apple.com\n and accept the latest license agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems with Homebrew\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: This one could be a variety of error messages, so there's not one in particular. You may see \"Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code\", but that same message could apply to other sources of error. So look for more identifying information about the error code. If you see something about \"unable to create /user/local/Homebrew/.git/index.lock: file exists\" then you have a Homebrew problem, as shown in the red circle below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: You'll need to uninstall Homebrew and then resinstall. Two simple copy and paste commands in Terminal.\n\n\nFirst you need to uninstal using this command in Terminal app:\n\n\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)\"\n\n\nAnd then repeat the installation command from step 7 in the build process by using this command in Terminal app:\n\n\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\n\nNow try building your Loop app again, you shouldn't have any problems.\n\n\nCould not get a container directory URL\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: \"\nCould not get a container directory URL. Please ensure App Groups are set up correctly in entitlements.\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo resolve this error, you will need to click on the Loop target's signing area and then the plus-sign in the App Groups area under the signing. Copy and paste the bundle indentifier into the new container that starts with \ngroup.\n and then add \nGroup\n to the end of the name. Click OK to save.\n\n\nThe final App Group should now have a blue check box, the name should start with \ngroup\n and end with \nLoopGroup\n. See the screenshot as an example. Click the build button after your App Group is setup similarly and you should be good.\n\n\nMissing Command Line Tools\n\u2301\n\n\nError message:  \"\nInvalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)\n\" or \"\nunable to find utility \"xcodebuild\", not a developer tool or in PATH\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: Go to your Xcode preferences and under the Locations tab, select \"Xcode 11.3\" in the dropdown menu for Command Line Tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevice Management could not launch Loop\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: \"Could not launch \"Loop\". Verify the Developer App certificate for your account is trusted on your device. Open Settings and navigate to General -\n Device Management, then select your Developer App certificate to trust it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: If you get this message and are unable to find the Device Management option in your phone settings, then we need to do a little extra step to clear out some old info.\n\n\n\n\nPlug phone in and open Loop in Xcode\n\n\nClick the \"Window\" menu item in Xcode and then choose \"Devices and Simulators\"\n\n\nRight click your phone on the left and pick \"Show Provisioning Profiles\"\n\n\nDelete all of the items in the list that have Loop in the name\n\n\nGo to your four signing targets and change the signing team back to \"None\" for a quick bit, and then change back to your regular signing team name again.\n\n\nRebuild Loop\n\n\n\n\nThat should clear out the old, unworking profiles and give you a successful build.\n\n\nIf your problem persists after that, then you can use a total reset to clear out the pesky problem:\n\n\n\n\nWipe the iPhone clean and setup as a new device\n\n\nDelete all certificates from your Developer account (you'll need to login to your Developer account to do that)\n\n\nDelete your old Loop code download and get a new one.\n\n\nRebuild Loop on the phone with the new download of Loop code.\n\n\n\n\nPending Certificate Request\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: \"You already have a current iOS Development certificate or a pending certificate request.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: This error message has just recently started to appear for some new Loop builders. To resolve the issue, please log in to your Developer account at \ndeveloper.apple.com\n and then click on \"Certificates, Identifiers \n Profiles\".  Under that screen, you will see \"Development\" under the \"Certificates\" section in the column on the left.  You will need to click on the certificates, and choose to \"revoke\" from the options that show after you click on the certificate. Confirm the warning message that will appear asking \"Do you want to revoke the certificate?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you do that, return to Xcode and open up Xcode preferences.  Under the Accounts section of Preferences, click on the minus sign to delete your Apple ID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-enter your Apple ID (yes...add that account right back that you literally just deleted), return to your Loop's target signing areas in Xcode and your error message should have resolved itself now as a new certificate will have been issued and a provisioning profile should have been created automatically.\n\n\nFor double measure, you can verify that the iOS development certificates are all in good working order by clicking on your \"Manage Certificates\" in your Xcode Preferences, Accounts and viewing the iOS development Certificates.  You should have one for your account that has a clean status similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand CodeSign failed\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: \"\nerrSecInternalComponent,  Command CodeSign failed with a nonzero exit code\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:  This error message is likely due to inadvertently saying \"no\" to allowing Keychain Access or changing your computer or AppleID password. Regardless, the solution is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nClose Xcode\n\n\nOpen your Keychain Access application (found in Applications within the Utilities folder, similar to where Terminal app is found)\n\n\nIn the upper left corner of keychain access, make sure you have the keychain \nlogin\n highlighted and then right-click the lock next to the \nlogin\n.  Click the lock closed, and then click the lock to open it again. You will be prompted for a password.  Enter your computer admin password.  Close Keychain Access app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen your Loop project again in Xcode.\n\n\nIn the main Xcode menu (grey menu bar at the very top of your Apple display area), select the word \nProduct\n and then select the option for \nClean\n. (keyboard shortcut is shift-command-k)\n\n\nNow try rebuilding your Loop app.  If you ever get prompted again to allow Xcode access to Keychain, make sure to Always Allow.\n\n\n\n\nUnrecognized arguments: --cache-builds\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: \"\nUnrecognized arguments: --cache-builds\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: Please open your Terminal app found in the Applications\nUtilities folder and then enter \n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n  Confirm installation by pressing enter, and then typing in your computer password.  When the installation finishes, use the command \nbrew link --overwrite carthage\n.  After those two steps, you can close out Terminal app, return to Xcode and press the build/play button again.\n\n\nAbort with Payload\n\u2301\n\n\nError message: \"\nAbort with payload\n\"  Your app will only open briefly with a white screen and then close, if you build with this error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: This error message is caused by having Loop download folder in an iCloud mapped drive.  Move your download folder back to the Downloads folder, then rebuild.\n\n\nApple Watch: Loop app not appearing\n\u2301\n\n\nError: \nApple watch app is not appearing\n.\n\n\nSolution: Usually because you have not updated to watchOS prior to when you built Loop, or you didn't have your Apple watch paired at the time of building Loop.  Don't forget to open the iPhone's Watch app, select My Watch tab on the bottom left, scroll all the way down, and click \nInstall\n for the Loop app listed at the very bottom under \"available apps\".\n\n\nApple Watch: Loop app not installing\n\u2301\n\n\nError: \nThe Loop app appears on the list of apps available to install on the watch, but when you press \"install\", and it goes through the animation of filling in the circle while it's installing, but then at the end it just toggles back to saying \"INSTALL\"\n.\n\n\nSolution:  Plug your iPhone into the computer and start Xcode.  On your watch, look for a prompt that says \"Trust this computer\".  Scroll down on the watch face and select the \"Trust\" button.  \n\n\nNow we need to do one step before rebuilding Loop app again. Go to the top menu bar of Xcode and select \"Clean Build Folder\" from the Product menu option. Rebuild your Loop app. \n\n\nFor an unknown reason (developers are working on fixing it currently), if you do repeated builds in the same Loop project folder...the watch app can fail to install properly after the first build. Therefore, a simple \"Clean Build Folder\" will reset the folder back to new and you should be able to install the watch after that fresh build.\n\n\nSometimes, if the problem is really a bugger...you have to do a more painful troubleshooting. If you still can't get the Loop app to install on the watch after a \"Clean Build Folder\" attempt at rebuilding, we need to start at square one. Unpair your watch from the iPhone and setup as a brand new device. Yes, pain in the butt. But, usually wiping the watch, re-pairing fresh, and then building Loop again on the phone will fix the issue. Sorry, wish I had a shorter path to fixing that problem, but this is where the current state is. This is a known bug and may take several tries and include wiping devices of content. It is a pain...but we really don't have a magic bullet solution other than keep trying...and starting your devices from scratch is a pain for sure...but also the most likely to get rid of the bug.",

The volunteer group of people answering questions in Looped and Zulipchat would love to spend more time on improving Loop in other ways than answering build error questions that can be answered by using this page as a first step.  Therefore, first use the error topics (listed in sections below) to try to resolve your build error yourself. Then, if you need to post for help because this page did not fix your problem, you'll need to include information with the post so we (the troubleshooters) know you read this page and where you are in your troubleshooting attempts   Must include in your post   The version of Xcode you are using  The version of Loop you are building with  The version of iOS on your Loop iPhone  Specify if you are using a free or paid account, and if free...confirm you deleted Siri and Push Notification capabilities  Confirm you are not using an Xcode beta or iOS beta version (so we don't have to ask, actually type \"I am not using beta versions\"...this will save a lot of time and hassle)  Screenshots of your WHOLE Xcode window and/or Terminal window showing your error and any messages you've seen while working through the build errors/solutions.  NOT phone pics.  See below for instructions on how to do this.  State which fixes from the below list that you have already tried AND post the screenshots of the results of those fix attempts.    Helpful tip: Shift-Command-4-spacebar will give you a screenshot tool that you can use to click on the Xcode window to grab a screenshot. The screenshot will save to your desktop so you can include it in your post. Phone photos of your computer screen won't likely be of sufficient clarity to read the needed information and often cuts off valuable information that we look for in the various parts of the Xcode window. Use the whole Xcode window's screenshot when posting for help.",

The key is to (1)  READ THE ERROR MESSAGE  and then (2)  FIND YOUR MESSAGE IN ONE OF THE TOPICS BELOW .  Here's a super tip: Merely seeing the \"exit code\" in Xcode is not enough information to discern what error is causing your build to fail - some exit codes can have multiple causes. Look at the detailed message to really help guide your search for the matching solution.  Notice how in the screenshots in the topics below, there are red circles highlighting certain error messages? Read your error messages similar to where those red circles are in the screenshots below. Once you find your error message (hint: not \"exit code\"), you can either:    Take the error message from your Xcode screen and use LoopDoc's search function to enter in some of that phrase to bring up the appropriate solution topic, or    Take the error message from your Xcode screen and read through EACH OF THE TOPICS BELOW. Check each of the red circles to see if you have a match. Kind of like a matching puzzle.    For example, if you see \"Invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)\" in your error message, use the search tool in LoopDocs with simply \"invalid active\". You will get a couple of links and one is the Command Line Tools fix for that error message. Click on the link and you'll find your solution.",

Now we need to do one step before rebuilding Loop app again. Go to the top menu bar of Xcode and select \"Clean Build Folder\" from the Product menu option. Rebuild your Loop app.   For an unknown reason (developers are working on fixing it currently), if you do repeated builds in the same Loop project folder...the watch app can fail to install properly after the first build. Therefore, a simple \"Clean Build Folder\" will reset the folder back to new and you should be able to install the watch after that fresh build.  Sometimes, if the problem is really a bugger...you have to do a more painful troubleshooting. If you still can't get the Loop app to install on the watch after a \"Clean Build Folder\" attempt at rebuilding, we need to start at square one. Unpair your watch from the iPhone and setup as a brand new device. Yes, pain in the butt. But, usually wiping the watch, re-pairing fresh, and then building Loop again on the phone will fix the issue. Sorry, wish I had a shorter path to fixing that problem, but this is where the current state is. This is a known bug and may take several tries and include wiping devices of content.

Seamless.\n\n\n\"Do I need to start a new pod when I update?\"\n No. Your existing pod session will continue seamlessly if you are using the same Developer Account to sign the Loop app targets as you did the last time you built.\n\n\n\"What if I'm using a new/different developer account?\"\n If you aren't building with the same developer account as your existing app was built with (this includes going from free to paid), then you will be installing a brand new (second) Loop app on your phone. Your existing pod won't work with the new app, so you might want to time this transition when you are due to change pods. Delete the old app once you get the new one all set up.\n\n\n\"What if it is a new computer but the same developer account?\"\n No big deal...you just want to make sure the computer has Homebrew installed already and you've added your developer account to Xcode preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to Update Loop\n\u2301\n\n\nYou will have to rebuild your Loop app at a minimum once every 12 months. The apps built and signed by you in Xcode with a paid developer account will only last for 12 months before they expire and need rebuilding. So, at least once per year you will have to rebuild your app and go through this update process.\n\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, you do not \nhave to\n update your Loop app until you are ready to grab new features. However, we encourage regular updates when a new version is released because they often contain bug fixes or improvements which may increase operational stability.\n\n\nStep 1: Install macOS and Xcode updates\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nUpdate to macOS (10.15.4 minimum currently for iOS 14)\n\n\nBetween Loop app builds, there's a high likelihood that Apple has updated one or more of the systems involved in your Loop app. If you miss macOS or Xcode updates, you may run into build problems. For example, the newest iOS 14 on your phone requires the newest Xcode version to properly build Loop.  In order to get that update, you need to be running macOS 10.15.4 at a minimum. Check for macOS updates and install as needed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate to Xcode (12.0.1 minimum currently for iOS 14)\n\n\nNow that you have updated your macOS, you should have the ability to see the most recent version of Xcode (12.0.1 or newer) in the App Store on your computer. \nUPDATE TO XCODE 12.0.1 BEFORE UPDATING YOUR LOOP APP. \n Phones running iOS 14 will not be able to have Loop installed using older Xcode versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart computer after updating Xcode\nMake sure to restart your computer after updating Xcode. There's a known issue that happens often enough to be frustrating if you don't reboot. Either a build error about missing simulators or a \"device not connected\" (even when phone is connected). Just restart computer. It's easy enough. It's not always required...but this is a good easy ounce of problem prevention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Check your Developer Account\n\u2301\n\n\nApple updates its License Agreement for the Developer Program frequently. You need to login to your \ndeveloper account\n to manually check if there is a new agreeement to accept.  If you see a big red or orange banner across the top of your Developer Account announcing a new license agreement like shown below...please read and accept it before building Loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Download Updated Loop Code\n\u2301\n\n\nAfter you've finished the updates to your devices listed above, you can move onto downloading updated Loop code. You will not be simply using your old downloaded Loop code (and in fact, you can delete those old folders now if you want). Click on \nONE\n of the links below to download an updated version of the Loop code. If you aren't a developer or debugging, stick to Master branch.  Click on ONE of the links below to download Loop code...hint hint...\nclick on the Master branch for 99% of users\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop: Master branch\n\n\n\n\nDev branch---in very rough shape right now, please only build if developer interested in debugging\n\n\nAutomatic-bolus branch---do your research before using as well, if you are asking what it is then you haven't researched enough yet\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Delete old provisioning profiles\n\u2301\n\n\nThis is a new step in the updating process. Everyone should do this step every time they rebuild or update their Loop apps now. Older versions of Xcode used to automatically create a \"provisioning profile\" as part of your Loop building process. That provisioning profile, among other things, sets the expiration date for your app. If you sign with a paid team, that profile is set to expire in 12 months. If you sign with a free team, that profile is set to expire in 7 days.\n\n\nYou can always check the expiration date at the time of building your loop app by clicking the little \"i\" icon next the \"Provisioning Profile\" line in the target signing area. Add 12 months to the \"created\" date (paid account), or 7 days (free account), and you'll have your app's date of future spontaneous death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's what started happening about a year ago with Xcode 11...the provisioning profiles weren't updating \"created\" date with new builds. Instead, Xcode was simply using the old profile's \"created\" date. This change has resulted in many people's apps expiring (and therefore dying suddenly) despite having updated/rebuilt within less than 12 months ago and having current developer accounts (either manually renewed or automatically renewed, doesn't matter).\n\n\nTo solve this new issue...we have an easy solution. Honest...easy. You can do this.\n\n\n\n\nHow to delete old provisioning profiles\n\n\n\n\nFind your Terminal app (the same one you used to install Homebrew in Step 7 of the build process if you forgot how to find it).\n\n\nOpen your Terminal app.\n\n\nCopy and paste the line in the little grey box below into the Terminal prompt. Press enter after you paste it.\n\n\n\n\nrm ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\\ Profiles/*.mobileprovision\n\n\nYou won't see anything special after you enter the command...your Terminal screen should look as boring as shown below when successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Build like normal\n\u2301\n\n\nFrom here, go straight to \nStep 14 Build Loop app\n and do just like you did the first time. Open the project, plug in the phone, select your phone, sign four targets, code customizations (if wanted), and then build button. Easy peasy.\n\n\n\n\nDouble check expiration date\n\n\nIf you want to make sure that step 4 above (deleting the provisioning profiles) went well...go ahead and check the \"created\" date on your provisioning profile after you sign your Loop target for this rebuild. It should have the current date as the \"created\" date and your Loop app will safely function for 12 more months (for paid accounts) so long as you keep your developer account paid/automatically renewed.\n\n\n\n\nNote: If this is a computer that hasn't built Loop before, you would want to make sure to do the \nBuild Step 7: install Homebrew\n before trying to build Loop using that computer.\n\n\nStep 6: Check Build Errors page if needed\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nCHECK BUILD ERRORS PAGE\n\n\nIf you get a build error...still check the \nBuild Errors page\n. Because even if your exact error isn't there...the information you NEED to provide when asking for help is listed out on that page. And that information is critical. CRITICAL to be able to troubleshoot your build error.",

But, if you are a newbie and not into crazy stuff...everything in here is completely and totally just optional. Using or not using LoopWorkspace does not affect your looping nor access to Loop. This page is about me finding an efficient way to answer questions about a topic that takes a lot of words to answer usually...so I'm saving time by making this page.\n\n\nTraditionally, Loopdocs has only told you about the option of downloading Loop as a zip file through those links. But, there's another way of getting that code to your computer called \"git\". Git is a system of \"distributed version control\" that allows remotely (as in not located in same place) collaborating people to work on one project and still track their changes to the same place. For example, if I sent 5 people one document to proof-read at the same time...it is quite possible that the edits I will get back from those 5 people would conflict with each other. Bob may have entirely deleted a sentence while Mary would have added words to that sentence. Git lets these remotely collaborating people deal with \"resolving conflict\" between versions more easily and merging suggestions (pull requests) into a coordinated space.\n\n\nSo, in using Git, we can do things with \"git commands\". Like \"Hey git...make me an exact copy of that guy's work over there.\" or \"Hey git, I'd like to compare my version of this page with Joe's version of the same page.\" Or using my old cookbook analogy...\"Hey git, I'd like to start a new cookbook called Italian Desserts.\"\n\n\nBut yes, git commands take awhile to properly use. And they are not plain english friendly. Or any kind of friendly really, at least not to very many people. Therefore, we have emphasized the downloading of a zip file to make you not have to use git.\n\n\nWhy this page?\n\u2301\n\n\nSo why am I about to tell you about a Loop repo that involves git? The answer is because LoopWorkspace is a pretty nice feature that you may run across if you are testing new features. And if you do, I do not want to be answering these How To questions in Zulipchat and Facebook repeatedly...so let's consolidate the info here.\n\n\n\n\nYou can still download zips\n\n\nYou do not have to use LoopWorkspace. Just to be clear, everything still works like it used to. LoopWorkspace is just a different option to save the amount of git and cartfile work that you would have to do otherwise. Depending on what you'd like to do, it may be a good option. Usually that \"good option\" is if you are trying new code that involves edits to the Loop frameworks.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is LoopWorkspace?\n\u2301\n\n\nI'm going to retread some info that you may have read in the Branches FAQs page earlier, but is really important to this discussion on LoopWorkspace. Loop developers own an account in GitHub called \nLoopKit\n.  Within that account, the developers have several \"repositories\" that support Loop in particular. A repository is like a book...let's think of it like a cookbook for now. Within the LoopKit account, there are repositories for Loop itself, LoopDocs, and various other supporting \"frameworks\" that are helper repositories for Loop to build correctly. For example, Loop's repo has a lot of the info about the app itself; the outward facing things that you interact with. How information is put to you and taken in from you...that's in Loop repository code. But, there's more than just a user interface for Loop. Loop has to do a lot of complex work like Bluetooth communications, algorithm math, pump communications, etc. The Loop app has help from frameworks to do those other parts. CGMBLEkit for some of the transmitter parts of Loop, RileyLink_ios for the pump managers (talking to the pumps and decoding their information), LoopKit for the algorithm about carbs and insulin curves, etc.\n\n\nWhen you build Loop, in the background, Loop pulls those other frameworks (7 in total) into the build process using \"Carthage\".  Carthage is like a personal shopper. You give it a shopping list (the cartfile in Loop code is that shopping list) and it goes and fetches that for you during the build process. The cartfile shows where the various frameworks are (exactly which GitHub account) and which branch to use. This is an example of what the cartfile looks like for dev branch right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of the frameworks also have their own cartfiles embedded in them. So, when developers are doing code changes in one of those frameworks, it gets to be a nest of effort to keep the cartfiles pointing to the right places and consistent in the embedded cartfiles for the various frameworks. \n\n\nAnd this is where LoopWorkspace comes in. LoopWorkspace uses submodules instead of cartfiles to define how the frameworks are coordinated for building. The workspace puts all the frameworks closer together and this makes the development process a LOT easier than managing cartfiles. A LOT EASIER. So, as new features might come out for testing, you may see LoopWorkspaces offered for that testing option instead of simply a downloaded zip. The ease of using workspace for developers is the reason why.\n\n\nHow do you \"get\" LoopWorkspace(s)?\n\u2301\n\n\nIn order to use a LoopWorkspace, you need to start using git commands in the Terminal app. The main LoopWorkspace is \nhere in the LoopKit account\n.  To get that to your computer, you'll need to \"clone\" it with this command:\n\n\ngit clone --branch=dev --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LoopKit/LoopWorkspace\n\n\nNow...look carefully...that is getting LoopKit's version of LoopWorkspace and grabbing the dev branch as the one you want to start working with.\n\n\nIf DeveloperBob had forked a copy of LoopKit's LoopWorkspace and made some changes he wanted to test, and then you wanted to grab them...you'd need to change the command to get DeveloperBob's version. And, you'd want to make sure you specify the branch that the new feature is on, too. DeveloperBob should usually include the branch name when he posts/shares. So, it might be something like:\n\n\ngit clone --branch=bitching-new-feature --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DeveloperBob/LoopWorkspace\n\n\nSo...if you are trying to grab someone's LoopWorkspace to use it, you'll need to make sure you get the command correct if they don't specify it for you.\n\n\nWhere does the clone go?\n\u2301\n\n\nThe cloned version of the LoopWorkspace will go into whatever directory you were sitting in in Terminal app when you did the command. Terminal app by default drops you into your User account's home directory when you first open it, so that's a good assumption on where your cloned LoopWorkspace will go.\n\n\nHow can you find your home directory?\n\n\n\n\nIn Terminal, if you use \ncd\n that will take you there automatically.\n\n\nIn Finder, shift-command-H will open your \"home\" folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, I have a lot of cloned things in my home directory from GitHub that involve Loop. You may have fewer...but be aware, you can always delete and reclone if you are in doubt or confused. You can't clone mutliple \"LoopWorkspaces\" into the exact same home directory (because they will have the same name), so you may want to create a subdirectory to put them in. Like you could make a folder called \"DeveloperJane\" and then move into that directory in Terminal before you clone DeveloperJane's LoopWorkspace. \n\n\nHow would you do that? Simple \ncd \n mkdir DeveloperJane\n would make the new folder in your home directory. And then \ncd DeveloperJane\n would move your Terminal app to be working inside the new DeveloperJane folder. So if you wanted to clone DeveloperJane's LoopWorkspace, that would be a good way to keep track of where the code came from.\n\n\nIf you ever get in doubt and can't remember where your code was cloned from, you can \ncd LoopWorkspace\n to get into your cloned directory and then use \ngit remote -v\n to tell you where it came from.\n\n\nUsing LoopWorkspace\n\u2301\n\n\nOnce you get your workspace cloned, you simply find that cloned folder (wherever you cloned it to...use Finder to find it) and double-click on the Loop.xcworkspace file to open the project in Xcode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you are in LoopWorkspace, everything is pretty similar for building with only two notable exceptions. You need to click on that blue Loop folder to see the signing targets, and you need to change the build scheme to the left of your phone to \"Loop (Workspace)\" in order to build properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh wait...there is a noticable difference...the speed! LoopWorkspace will build Loop much faster than Loop because of the way it uses submodules. I do rather like that benefit to using LoopWorkspaces too.\n\n\nUpdating Loop using LoopWorkspace\n\u2301\n\n\nWhen you want to update your Loop app using LoopWorkspace, you'd just do a \ngit pull --recurse\n while in the LoopWorkspace directory in Terminal. That will grab the lastest updates and then you can build. If you still have signing team filled in, you may get a conflict on the command...so either unsign before the git pull or do a \ngit stash\n and then pull.\n\n\nAnd with that ends the super basic \"How can I build with a LoopWorkspace?\" questions and use for 90% of the users.\n\n\nChecking out different branches within a LoopWorkspace\n\u2301\n\n\nMore advanced users...I'm not going to explain this in quite so much detail, but yes, you can individually change the branches in a LoopWorkspace. \n\n\nThere are 2 main ways to do this. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're already familiar with Git, the easiest way is to \ncd\n into the appropriate repository (like \ncd rileylink_ios\n) and \ncheckout\n the desired branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're not as familiar with Git, if you edit your .gitmodules directory in LoopWorkspace, you can specify other repos to use (and add a line to specify branches, too). Then if you do a \ngit submodule sync\n the workspace will sync to new submodules. Then \ngit submodule update --init --recursive --remote\n will update all the submodules to the right branches and get HEADs detached correctly, etc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPushing commits from LoopWorkspace\n\u2301\n\n\nSo you've got a great idea for a new feature, made those changes to your LoopWorkspace and want to get them into Github. Awesome!\n\n\nTo understand how to do this, we'll need to understand a bit more about how Git keeps track of changes. In Git, developers can have different \"branches\" (see the \nbranch FAQs page\n for more details about what a branch is). There are two different types of branches: remote and local. If you were to fork Loop on Github, then the branches that you can see on Github are \"remote\" branches - they're hosted on the Github server. On the other hand, you can also create \"local\" branches that are stored directly on your computer by \"checking out\" the remote branch. You'll need to \"commit\" your changes to the local branch, then \"push\" those changes to the remote branch in order to be able to see them in Github. There are specific commands that you can type into the command line to do all of these actions, but I'm not going to go into detail because there are different ways (like graphic Git editors) that can an easier way to do them.\n\n\nIt's a little easier to think about this with an analogy. Let's say you're working at a company that's creating a cookbook. There's a centralized, production-ready version of the cookbook on their website that all the employees can view. Think of the website version of this cookbook as being like the remote branch. You're assigned to change the pancake recipe in the cookbook. Since the company doesn't want employees to make changes directly to the version of the cookbook that the customers see, you need to make a copy of it on your computer so you can make your changes to the pancake recipe. When you make the personal copy on your computer, it's like \"checking out\" the remote branch. Your copy is like the local branch - you can make whatever changes you want without having to worry about customers accidentally seeing them. When you make an important change to the recipe (like adding a photo or changing the ingredients), you might want to make a note in the edit history so that you can go back to that version of the recipe in case you accidentally make unintended changes - those notes you make would be \"commits\". Once you're happy with the recipe, you'll add it back into the production version of the cookbook on the website, which is similar to what you're doing when you \"push\" your changes. \n\n\nWhere do the submodules fit in? Each submodule is actually a branch, so when you make changes to multiple submodules, you'll need to commit those changes to their respective branches. Let's say you've made changes to Loop and LoopKit. You'll need to go into Loop and commit + push the changes, then go into LoopKit and commit + push the changes. \n\n\nThere are a few different ways to keep track of all these different branches. Some people like using the command line (which is what you're using when you do commands like \ngit clone\n) because it's very customizable and has the largest variety of commands. Others like to use graphic Git editors, which make it easier to see changes and be able to do a variety of common actions (like cloning, committing, and pushing) with the push of a button. Everyone has their own preferences, but some methods that Loop contributors have used in the past include the command line, \nGitkraken\n, and \nSourceTree\n.",

But, if you are a newbie and not into crazy stuff...everything in here is completely and totally just optional. Using or not using LoopWorkspace does not affect your looping nor access to Loop. This page is about me finding an efficient way to answer questions about a topic that takes a lot of words to answer usually...so I'm saving time by making this page.  Traditionally, Loopdocs has only told you about the option of downloading Loop as a zip file through those links. But, there's another way of getting that code to your computer called \"git\". Git is a system of \"distributed version control\" that allows remotely (as in not located in same place) collaborating people to work on one project and still track their changes to the same place. For example, if I sent 5 people one document to proof-read at the same time...it is quite possible that the edits I will get back from those 5 people would conflict with each other. Bob may have entirely deleted a sentence while Mary would have added words to that sentence. Git lets these remotely collaborating people deal with \"resolving conflict\" between versions more easily and merging suggestions (pull requests) into a coordinated space.  So, in using Git, we can do things with \"git commands\". Like \"Hey git...make me an exact copy of that guy's work over there.\" or \"Hey git, I'd like to compare my version of this page with Joe's version of the same page.\" Or using my old cookbook analogy...\"Hey git, I'd like to start a new cookbook called Italian Desserts.\"  But yes, git commands take awhile to properly use. And they are not plain english friendly. Or any kind of friendly really, at least not to very many people. Therefore, we have emphasized the downloading of a zip file to make you not have to use git.",

You can still download zips  You do not have to use LoopWorkspace. Just to be clear, everything still works like it used to. LoopWorkspace is just a different option to save the amount of git and cartfile work that you would have to do otherwise. Depending on what you'd like to do, it may be a good option.

            "text": "I'm going to retread some info that you may have read in the Branches FAQs page earlier, but is really important to this discussion on LoopWorkspace. Loop developers own an account in GitHub called  LoopKit .  Within that account, the developers have several \"repositories\" that support Loop in particular. A repository is like a book...let's think of it like a cookbook for now. Within the LoopKit account, there are repositories for Loop itself, LoopDocs, and various other supporting \"frameworks\" that are helper repositories for Loop to build correctly. For example, Loop's repo has a lot of the info about the app itself; the outward facing things that you interact with. How information is put to you and taken in from you...that's in Loop repository code. But, there's more than just a user interface for Loop. Loop has to do a lot of complex work like Bluetooth communications, algorithm math, pump communications, etc. The Loop app has help from frameworks to do those other parts. CGMBLEkit for some of the transmitter parts of Loop, RileyLink_ios for the pump managers (talking to the pumps and decoding their information), LoopKit for the algorithm about carbs and insulin curves, etc.  When you build Loop, in the background, Loop pulls those other frameworks (7 in total) into the build process using \"Carthage\".  Carthage is like a personal shopper. You give it a shopping list (the cartfile in Loop code is that shopping list) and it goes and fetches that for you during the build process. The cartfile shows where the various frameworks are (exactly which GitHub account) and which branch to use. This is an example of what the cartfile looks like for dev branch right now.      Many of the frameworks also have their own cartfiles embedded in them. So, when developers are doing code changes in one of those frameworks, it gets to be a nest of effort to keep the cartfiles pointing to the right places and consistent in the embedded cartfiles for the various frameworks.   And this is where LoopWorkspace comes in. LoopWorkspace uses submodules instead of cartfiles to define how the frameworks are coordinated for building. The workspace puts all the frameworks closer together and this makes the development process a LOT easier than managing cartfiles. A LOT EASIER. So, as new features might come out for testing, you may see LoopWorkspaces offered for that testing option instead of simply a downloaded zip. The ease of using workspace for developers is the reason why.",

If DeveloperBob had forked a copy of LoopKit's LoopWorkspace and made some changes he wanted to test, and then you wanted to grab them...you'd need to change the command to get DeveloperBob's version. And, you'd want to make sure you specify the branch that the new feature is on, too. DeveloperBob should usually include the branch name when he posts/shares. So, it might be something like:  git clone --branch=bitching-new-feature --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DeveloperBob/LoopWorkspace  So...if you are trying to grab someone's LoopWorkspace to use it, you'll need to make sure you get the command correct if they don't specify it for you.",

Terminal app by default drops you into your User account's home directory when you first open it, so that's a good assumption on where your cloned LoopWorkspace will go.  How can you find your home directory?   In Terminal, if you use  cd  that will take you there automatically.  In Finder, shift-command-H will open your \"home\" folder.       As you can see, I have a lot of cloned things in my home directory from GitHub that involve Loop. You may have fewer...but be aware, you can always delete and reclone if you are in doubt or confused. You can't clone mutliple \"LoopWorkspaces\" into the exact same home directory (because they will have the same name), so you may want to create a subdirectory to put them in. Like you could make a folder called \"DeveloperJane\" and then move into that directory in Terminal before you clone DeveloperJane's LoopWorkspace.   How would you do that? Simple  cd   mkdir DeveloperJane  would make the new folder in your home directory. And then  cd DeveloperJane  would move your Terminal app to be working inside the new DeveloperJane folder. So if you wanted to clone DeveloperJane's LoopWorkspace, that would be a good way to keep track of where the code came from.

To understand how to do this, we'll need to understand a bit more about how Git keeps track of changes. In Git, developers can have different \"branches\" (see the  branch FAQs page  for more details about what a branch is). There are two different types of branches: remote and local. If you were to fork Loop on Github, then the branches that you can see on Github are \"remote\" branches - they're hosted on the Github server. On the other hand, you can also create \"local\" branches that are stored directly on your computer by \"checking out\" the remote branch. You'll need to \"commit\" your changes to the local branch, then \"push\" those changes to the remote branch in order to be able to see them in Github. There are specific commands that you can type into the command line to do all of these actions, but I'm not going to go into detail because there are different ways (like graphic Git editors) that can an easier way to do them.  It's a little easier to think about this with an analogy. Let's say you're working at a company that's creating a cookbook. There's a centralized, production-ready version of the cookbook on their website that all the employees can view. Think of the website version of this cookbook as being like the remote branch. You're assigned to change the pancake recipe in the cookbook. Since the company doesn't want employees to make changes directly to the version of the cookbook that the customers see, you need to make a copy of it on your computer so you can make your changes to the pancake recipe. When you make the personal copy on your computer, it's like \"checking out\" the remote branch. Your copy is like the local branch - you can make whatever changes you want without having to worry about customers accidentally seeing them.

Using the standard setting, Loop sets the default to a full 3 days. You can set the reminder to any day and time up until 80 hours. This changes the PDM default which sets the alert always to 2 hours before a full 3-day (72 hours) run. This assumes you will not have run out of insulin before that time. In the event your Pod runs out of insulin, then you will get a \"Pod empty\" notification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Time Zone: If you are traveling for short periods of time, you do not have to worry about changing the time on your Pod. However, if you are going to be away from home for longer periods of time, you will want to update your Pod's basal schedule to match local time by selecting the \nChange Time Zone\n command when convenient. Using this command will move your basal schedule on your current Pod to the new time. If you start a new Pod session the new time zone will be used. Please wait until you see \nSucceeded\n appear on the page to ensure the command has successfully been received by the Pod.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Command: This command is used only by the developers to test Omnipod commands in Loop.

The headings will match the flow of the screen, top to bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first circled section covers your Loop's closed/open loop status and Loop's Issue Report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second circled section is the configuration section. This section contains a lot of really important settings that control how your Loop will calculate your predicted BG curve. Given the importance of your predicted BG curve to Loop's actions, please make sure you read over this page carefully to know how to navigate the selections and entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosed/Open Loop\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Closed Loop switch controls whether Loop automatically enacts its recommended temporary basal adjustments (closed loop mode) or whether you have to manually tap to enact the recommendations (open loop mode). In addition to the visual indicator on this switch discussed below, the \nLoop's status icon on the main screen\n will also appear differently depending on the mode selected. Open loop mode will have an incomplete circle for the Loop's status icon.\n. \n\n\nOpen Loop Mode\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Closed Loop switch is in the (Off\n   ) position, Loop WILL NOT enact recommended temp basals automatically. Instead, Loop will display recommended temp basals on the main status display, just above the blood glucose graph. This is called \nopen loop\n, and is a good way to understand how Loop will function, and what type of recommendations it would make. If you click on the recommended temp basal line while in open loop mode, Loop will implement the temp basal.\n\n\nClosed Loop Mode\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen the Closed Loop switch is in the (\n   On) position, Loop WILL automatically enact recommended temp basals on the configured insulin pump. This is known as \nclosed loop\n. Typically, Loop will show the recommended temp basal just above the blood glucose graph prior to automatically enacting it. It may take a minute or so for the Loop to enact the recommended basal. Once the temp basal has been enacted successfully on the pump, the recommended temp basal will disappear from the screen and the new temp basal rate will be represented in the insulin delivery graphs.\n\n\nIssue Report\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you run into problems or errors with your Loop, an Issue Report can be used to help identify where the problem is occurring. The Issue Report is automatically generated and you can share it via email. Frequently, if you seek help with a technical problem, an Issue Report will provide insight for the developers and troubleshooters. Please email yourself an Issue Report anytime you are questioning Loop actions or displays. You can then use that Issue Report later to help debug the problem.\n\n\n\n\nBefore you continue further, a word about BG units\n\n\nEntries into the configuration section will be available in mg/dL or mmol/L automatically, based upon how your blood glucose values are received. By default they are set to mg/dL, however once CGM values arrive in mmol/L these Loop settings can be entered in mmol/L. \nIf you are planning to use mmol/L, be sure to wait to set your entries until after you have started to receive CGM values in Loop.\n If you do these in the wrong order, then your charts and entries may have incorrect units.\n\n\n\n\nCorrection Range\n\u2301\n\n\nThe correction range is your blood glucose range that you would like Loop to correct to. Correction range is not necessarily the same target blood glucose range that you have discussed with your endocrinologist; generally the doctor's range may be much wider. For example, you may keep a correction target of 100-110 for Loop to aim to, but use a desired BG target range of 80-180 when discussing things with your endo about \"time in range\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the + in the upper right corner to add correction BG range(s). You can have multiple ranges based on time of day, but the first setting of the day needs to begin at midnight.\n\n\nCorrection ranges can be a single number, such as 100-100 mg/dL, or a range such as 100-120 mg/dL. Generally speaking, if you choose to use a range, keeping the range between about 10-30 mg/dL between the lowest and highest value is a good starting place.\n\n\nOverride Ranges\n\u2301\n\n\nBelow the Correction Range entry is a section called \"Overrides\" with a Pre-Meal setting. While active, the pre-meal targets will replace the usual correction range for Loop's temp basal recommendations. If a pre-meal range is not entered in this section, the icon will remain grey and unusable on the main screen's toolbar.\n\n\nThe pre-meal override target can be used to as an easy way to get a small amount of insulin delivered before a meal in order to help control post-meal blood glucose spikes.\n\n\nIf your normal target is 100-110 mg/dL and pre-meal target is 80-80 mg/dL, for example, Loop will give you an extra push to get you to the lower target number before the meal. This early insulin brings you into the meal with a mini-prebolus. The pre-meal target, when activated by pressing on the icon, will stay active for one hour, until carbs are entered, or until it is manually cancelled...whichever comes first.\n\n\nLoop will adjust any insulin bolus as needed based on the extra insulin provided during this pre-meal time.\n\n\nSuspend Threshold\n\u2301\n\n\nThe suspend threshold must be set up for successful configuration of Loop. \nYour Loop will not turn green without setting this value.\n This value affects both bolus and basal recommendations by Loop.\n\n\nBolus\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nIf you are trying to bolus a meal while any part of the predicted BG curve is below this suspend threshold value, Loop will not recommend a bolus.  Instead, you will need to wait until your prediction curve is above the suspend threshold value in order to bolus.\n\n\n\n\nBasal\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nIf your current or any point on your predicted BG curve is below the suspend threshold, Loop will always recommend a temporary basal rate of 0 U/hr.\n\n\n\n\nReasonable settings for suspend threshold will depend on user preference, but recommended not set lower than 65 mg/dL.\n\n\nBasal Rates\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nNote: You cannot enter basal rates until you first add a pump in Loop settings.\n Your basal rates will be initially populated when you walk through the \nAdd Pump\n part of the setup at the beginning of this setup guide.  \n\n\n\n\nOnly one basal schedule may be set in each Loop app. The basal increments are available according to the increments of the particular pump/pod you are using. Not all pumps provide the same increments for basal deliveries. Basal schedule must start at midnight and cannot contain rates of 0 U/hr.\n\n\nTo edit a line in your basal schedule, tap the line and adjust the time and/or amount.  To remove a line, select Edit in the top right and delete it.  If tapping the line doesn't work, try closing and re-opening the app.  When finished editing, click on the \nSave to Pump...\n or \nSync With Pod\n button, depending on which pump you are using. \n\n\n\n\nIf you make any basal edits and use the \nCancel\n button to go back to the menu without successfully saving/syncing to pump/pod, the changes you made will not be saved. Loop makes saving/syncing to pump a mandatory step to successfully editing basal rates. If you get an error message while trying to save/sync the edited basal rates, please retry until successful.\n\n\n\n\nDelivery Limits\n\u2301\n\n\nThe maximum basal rate and maximum bolus settings are collectively referred to as Delivery Limits. This section will have been initially populated when you finished the \nAdd Pump\n part of the setup previously. For safety, similar to basal schedule, you must keep these values the same on both the Loop app and within the pump/pod settings. If you edit these settings in Loop app, always use the \nSave to Pump...\n or \nSync With Pod\n button, depending on which pump you are using.\n\n\nMaximum Basal Rate\n\u2301\n\n\nMaximum basal rate will cap the the maximum temporary basal rate that the Loop is allowed to enact to meet your correction range. Typically, Loop users set their maximum basal rate around 3-4 times their highest scheduled basal rate. When you are first beginning to use Loop, it is wise to start conservative (low) in setting your maximum basal rate. If your settings are incorrect in other areas (basal rates, insulin sensitivity, carb ratio, etc), you may need time to identify where settings need to be adjusted. This process is easier if Loop is given less latitude to set high basal rates. Gradually increase your maximum basal rate as your comfort and confidence in Loop increases. If you need help with your settings adjustment, head over to LoopTips for some \ninitial settings help\n\n\nMaximum Bolus\n\u2301\n\n\nEnter your desired single bolus maximum here. For safety, don't set a maximum bolus limit any higher than your typical large meal bolus.\n\n\nInsulin Model\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are four insulin models to choose from; Walsh, Rapid-Acting Adults, Rapid-Acting Children, and Fiasp. If you want to read the nitty-gritty discussion that went into the development of the Rapid-Acting and Fiasp curves (collectively called \"exponential insulin models\"), you can see that in GitHub \nhere\n.\n\n\nWe highly recommend selecting one of the exponential insulin models (in other words, not the Walsh model).\n \n\n\nA common new Loop user error is to select Walsh model in order to easily shorten their insulin duration (DIA) to one like they used prior to Looping. This almost invariably leads to insulin stacking. If you would like to read more about why the duration of insulin action is important in Loop vs how you've traditionally used it, please click \nhere\n to read a blog post about the subject. In summary, choosing Walsh curve just to shorten your DIA will lead to insulin stacking and less than desired bolusing recommendations.\n\n\nYou can click on each model and see what each model's insulin activity curve looks like, active one selected in blue. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe differences between the three exponential models (two Rapid-Acting and Fiasp) models has to do with the timing of the peak insulin activity timing. Not surprising, since Fiasp is marketed as the \"faster acting\" insulin. Currently all the exponential models are defaulted to an insulin duration of 6 hours, but the peak activity of the curves differs:\n\n\n\n\nRapid-acting adult curve peaks at 75 minutes\n\n\nRapid-acting child curve peaks at 65 minutes\n\n\nFiasp peaks curve peaks at 55 minutes\n\n\n\n\nCarb Ratios\n\u2301\n\n\nClick the + in the upper right to add carb ratios for various times of day. Loop works best if you have \ntested and optimized\n your carb ratio settings for accuracy.\n\n\n\n\nBeware of other apps writing carbs to Health app\n\n\nIf you are using a third-party app (such as Spike or MyFitness) that can write carbohydrates to the phone's Health app, you will need to edit the permissions to make sure Loop doesn't double carb entries.  You should disable the third-party app's permissions in Health so that they can only \nread\n and not \nwrite\n.  See \nCarb Entries with Third Party apps\n for more information about this setting.\n\n\n\n\nInsulin Sensitivities\n\u2301\n\n\nInsulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF) is the same term as Correction Factor used in some clinics and endocrinology offices. ISF represents the drop in blood glucose levels expected from one unit of insulin. Click the + in the upper right to add insulin sensitivities for various times of day. Loop works best if you have \ntested and optimized\n your ISF settings for accuracy. Insulin sensitivities can change for many reasons including waiting too long to change your infusion set. Loop will not auto-detect changes in ISF.\n\n\nIncorrectly set ISF is the most common cause of roller coaster BGs for new Loop users. You will need to raise (increase) your ISF value/number to help smooth a roller coaster BG trend. You can read about that topic more over in LoopTips \nhere\n. \n\n\nNext Step: Loop Services\n\u2301\n\n\nYou have completed the required configurations and settings in your Loop app. If you have a Nightscout site you'd like to connect Loop to, please continue on to the \nLoop Services page\n. \n\n\nIf you are not integrating with a Nightscout site and don't want any optional logging services connected, then please proceed to the \nLoop's displays page\n. Understanding the Loop displays can be a valuable tool to understanding your Loop's actions, and also for troubleshooting, if you are having issues.",

If you want to read the nitty-gritty discussion that went into the development of the Rapid-Acting and Fiasp curves (collectively called \"exponential insulin models\"), you can see that in GitHub  here .  We highly recommend selecting one of the exponential insulin models (in other words, not the Walsh model).    A common new Loop user error is to select Walsh model in order to easily shorten their insulin duration (DIA) to one like they used prior to Looping. This almost invariably leads to insulin stacking. If you would like to read more about why the duration of insulin action is important in Loop vs how you've traditionally used it, please click  here  to read a blog post about the subject. In summary, choosing Walsh curve just to shorten your DIA will lead to insulin stacking and less than desired bolusing recommendations.  You can click on each model and see what each model's insulin activity curve looks like, active one selected in blue.      The differences between the three exponential models (two Rapid-Acting and Fiasp) models has to do with the timing of the peak insulin activity timing. Not surprising, since Fiasp is marketed as the \"faster acting\" insulin. Currently all the exponential models are defaulted to an insulin duration of 6 hours, but the peak activity of the curves differs:   Rapid-acting adult curve peaks at 75 minutes  Rapid-acting child curve peaks at 65 minutes  Fiasp peaks curve peaks at 55 minutes",

Information about your Loop's actions (or inactions) can often be found simply by looking at the visuals presented in the app.  \n\n\nStatus Screen\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Status Screen is the main root navigation screen in Loop. It is broken up into 3 main display areas; Heads Up Display (HUD), Charts, and Toolbar. The HUD is the top area of the screen. This shows the status of the last time loop ran, current BG Reading, current temp basal, and current pump information. The next area is the charting area. This includes, glucose trend and prediction, Active Insulin, Insulin Delivery, and Carbohydrates. The final display area is the toolbar which has buttons for Carbs, Pre-Meal, Bolus, Overrides, and Settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeads Up Display\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Heads Up Display (HUD) is a very useful quick reference guide to your Loop's status. Every 5 minutes, Loop updates CGM and pump/pod data. Loop timestamps the HUD data with the last data point that came in. If a timestamp goes older than 5 minutes old, that is a valuable indicator to where your Loop is failing to get the needed information. The HUD's first three icons, from left to right, are the same no matter whether you are using a Medtronic pump or Omnipod; status of the last time loop ran, current BG Reading, and current temp basal. The last two icons will change depending on what type of pump you are using.\n\n\nMedtronic users: The last two icons are the most recent (1) pump/reservoir status and (2) pump percentage battery remaining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmnipod users: The last two icons are the most recent (1) pod/reservoir status and (2) hours of pod use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop Status\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Loop Status is the colored circle in the upper left corner of the main Loop display.  There are four colors that are typically displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA grey circle indicates the Loop is warming up and hasn\u2019t yet completed its initial loop.  When the Loop is first activated, it may take about 15-20 minutes to complete the first Loop, and the grey circle will be displayed.  It needs CGM data to be gathered, so be patient.  When it finally completes its first loop, the circle will turn green.  If you can't get your grey loop to turn green, please see the \nGrey Loop troubleshooting page\n for tips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA green circle indicates the Loop has been successfully completed within the last 5 minutes.  The time since the loop last completed will be displayed under the circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA yellow circle indicates the Loop has not completed in the last 5-15 minutes.  It is not unusual to have a few instances of yellow circles throughout a day of looping.  They can be caused by temporarily getting too far away from RileyLink or iPhone (more than about 3-10 feet depending on conditions), CGM failing to read or being in ???, radio frequency \u201cnoise\u201d interference, and such.  Generally, most yellow circles will self-resolve without needing any special troubleshooting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA red circle indicates the Loop has not completed in over 15 minutes.  This is not a typical state, and you should troubleshoot why Loop is not completing.  Please review the \nYellow and Red Loop troubleshooting page\n for tips on how to get your green Loop back.  Clicking on the red circle will also pop-up the last error message to help guide your troubleshooting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the circle is notched and not complete, that means the Loop is operating in \u201copen-loop\u201d mode.  When the \u201cclosed-loop\u201d setting is turned on, the loop status will show a completed circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe loop status circle will pulse slightly when the RileyLink is giving the pump a new temp basal setting.  The pulsing will stop when the temp basal has been set by the pump.\n\n\nGlucose\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current BG reading from the CGM will display, including trending arrow and time the reading was taken.  If the BG is being read straight from the G5 transmitter or G4 receiver, no special symbols will appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the BG is being read from the Dexcom Share Servers, a small cloud icon will be in the corner of the BG reading.  Internet access is required to run in this mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you first start Loop, there may be a small yellow alert next to the BG.  This should go away within a short period of time (around 5 minutes or less).  If the yellow alert remains, something may be wrong with fetching BG data.  You can try restarting the Loop app (double tap home button, up-swipe on the app to close it) to see if BG data will resume.  \nSpecial note for Dexcom G5 users\n, a yellow alert will appear when calibration is needed.  The alert will clear once the calibration is given, but typically Loop will work IF the yellow alert is only for a needed G5 calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemp Basal\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe temp basal will display the enacted temp basal change relative to the scheduled basal.  So if the scheduled basal was 1.0 units per hour and Loop has set a temp basal of 0.2 units per hour, the temp basal icon will display -0.8 U, as shown in the graphic to the left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReservoir (Medtronic Users)\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reservoir icon will remain grey and plain until insulin volume decreases.  At 25% reservoir volume remaining, the reservoir icon will turn yellow.  At 10% reservoir volume remaining, the reservoir icon will turn red.  The remaining units will be displayed when it gets to these lower thresholds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery (Medtronic Users)\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor x23, x54 pumps, the battery icon will show 100/75/50/25% increments just as the pump does.  As the battery level decreases, the icon will turn from grey to yellow to red.  For x22 pumps, the battery icon will read discrete % values.  \nThe warning colors/levels on Loop's battery indicator work in conjunction with the type of battery selected.  If you change battery types, please make sure to update your battery selection in the Loop app settings.   \nThe pump's on-screen battery indicator is not a good indicator of remaining battery life for the purposes of looping.  Loop's pump communications will fail from low battery levels sooner than the insulin delivery will fail.  The Loop's battery level warnings are designed to give you approximately 8 hours of notice before the pump battery will need changing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReservoir (Omnipod Users)\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pod icon will remain grey and plain until insulin volume decreases.  At 50 units or less insulin remaining, the reservoir icon will turn yellow. At 20 units or less remaining, the reservoir icon will turn red.  The remaining units will be displayed when it gets to these lower thresholds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPod Age (Omnipod Users)\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pod's age, typically a 3-day lifespan, is represented by three equal segments of the pod age icon. As the pod ages, the segments are converted to a darker grey color. At 54 hours old, the pod age icon will turn yellow. At 72 hours old, the pod age icon will turn red, the pod will begin the periodic alarm, and the pod age icon will show a \"replace pod\" message in the HUD. When you reach 80 hours of pod use, the pod will have a sustained alarm and stop working.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharts\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are several charts that help you navigate your Loop actions.  Clicking on each of the charts will also open up additional information.\n\n\nGlucose Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe glucose chart displays BG values in your preferred units. The vertical scale of the chart is calculated on the fly by Loop to be as useful as possible while including the highest and lowest readings in the chart.\n\n\nThe horizontal axis is set to go forward from the current time until your DIA (insulin duration) forward (so you can see what Loop thinks BG will be eventually). It then goes back in time as far as it can, based upon the width in pixels of your screen. Note, if you turn your device to landscape mode you will have more screen real estate and thus will be able to see further back in time.\n\n\nThe BG correction range is shown as a blue bar on the glucose chart.  Single-value target BG range (such as 100-100 mg/dl), will have a narrower blue range.  When a temporary override range is enabled, a darker blue bar where the overrides are set will be displayed, as well as the normal correction target in lighter blue.\n\n\nThe eventual BG displayed on the right side of the chart does NOT take into account a recently enacted temp basal.  In other words, if you are above BG target and Loop just enacted a high temp basal to help, the eventual BG does not reflect the expected lowering of BGs that would result from that recently enacted temp basal.  Loop waits until the insulin has actually been delivery before it \"uses\" the insulin in its calculations for BG impacts.  If you suspended your pump or had a \"no delivery\" alarm shortly after the temp basal was started, you would want that accurately reflected in the insulin on board and associated eventual BG.\n\n\nIf you tap on the Glucose Chart itself, it will open the Predicted Glucose chart described below.\n\n\nPredicted Glucose Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe predicted glucose view is a great way to gain insight into the various components\u2019 importance in Loop\u2019s prediction of eventual BG. The graph at the top of this view will match your Glucose Chart. Below this chart you will see a very detailed explanation of all of the variables that Loop takes into account in predicting your future BG value. Each of those effects (including Carbohydrates, Insulin, Glucose Momentum and Retrospective Correction) includes details of the calculation used. You can tap on any of the entries to turn them off and on for visualization. The resulting changes can be viewed by the changes in the dashed lines.\n\n\nAdditionally, at the bottom of this screen there is a setting to \nEnable Retrospective Correction\n. By enabling it, it will more aggressively increase or decrease basal delivery when BG movement doesn\u2019t match the carbohydrates and insulin-based model.  Most Loopers have found this setting to be quite useful and keep the slider on.\n\n\nActive Insulin Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Active Insulin chart displays the total insulin contribution from both temp basals and boluses.  Active IOB can be either positive and negative IOB.  Negative IOB results from the suspension of normally scheduled basals.  The active insulin displayed in the upper right corner of the chart does NOT include insulin contributions from a recently enacted temp basal or bolus until the pump\u2019s reservoir volume is read and confirms a drop in reservoir volume (confirming the insulin has actually been delivered).  So long as you have Event History as the Preferred Data Source in Loop settings (does not apply to Omnipod, Minimed Only), primed insulin deliveries (e.g., cannula fills or manual primes) will not be counted towards IOB.\n\n\nInsulin Delivery Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Insulin Delivery chart displays a history of the temp basals enacted by Loop.  The display is relative to the scheduled basal rates entered in the Loop settings.  So, a rate displayed in this chart as \n+0 units\n would indicate no temp basal was set, and Loop defaulted to the scheduled basal rate.  Individual boluses are indicated by an orange triangle on the chart (shown in the graphic above, near the left-most time).  The total insulin delivered since midnight, including all basals and boluses \nAND priming insulin\n, is given in the upper right corner of the graph.\n\n\nPlease be patient for a bolus delivery to appear.  There is a lag time from when you press the \u201cdeliver\u201d bolus button to when the orange triangle is drawn sometimes.  The insulin has to be delivered and then the pump reservoir needs to be read to confirm delivery, before the triangle will appear and IOB will be added.  Occasionally, the bolus may be temporarily rendered (drawn) as a very high temp basal rate vs. a (triangle) discrete bolus event.  This does NOT mean that the Loop actually enacted a high temp basal rate...only that the bolus is being \ndrawn\n on the chart in the equivalent of a high temp basal rate.\n\n\nReservoir and Event History\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClicking on either the Active Insulin or Insulin Delivery charts will open your Insulin Delivery history.  The top of the screen will display the current IOB and the total insulin delivered for the day since midnight (or since the time the loop became active if you started Loop after midnight). There are two viewing options; Reservoir or Event History.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReservoir: Omnipod users will not have a reservoir history displayed, simply because pods do not report or track insulin remaining until their reservoirs get below 50 units remaining. Medtronic users will have reservoir history displayed in 5-minute increments, unless Loop has been having communication issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent History: Event history is a detailed accounting of all pump/pod actions. Both Medtronic and Omnipod users will have a detailed record of event history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbohydrate Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Carbohydrate chart displays the carbs used by Loop to predict BG changes.  The active COB is displayed in the upper right corner of the chart.  Clicking on the chart will open the Carb Entries history and you can edit/delete any previous entries through that screen.  Please read the \nCarb Entries page\n for more information about editing carb entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about the Insulin Counteraction Effects information found in the Carb History, please see \nhere\n.\n\n\nTool Bar\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe toolbar is where your inputs to the Loop behavior take place.  The individual components of the toolbar are, left to right:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarb entry tool\n- click on this tool to enter carbs into the Loop app.  Loop will not read carb entries from the pump or Nightscout, so you must use the carb entry tool in Loop app in order to have carbs accounted for by the Loop.

A green circle indicates the Loop has been successfully completed within the last 5 minutes.  The time since the loop last completed will be displayed under the circle.     A yellow circle indicates the Loop has not completed in the last 5-15 minutes.  It is not unusual to have a few instances of yellow circles throughout a day of looping.  They can be caused by temporarily getting too far away from RileyLink or iPhone (more than about 3-10 feet depending on conditions), CGM failing to read or being in ???, radio frequency \u201cnoise\u201d interference, and such.  Generally, most yellow circles will self-resolve without needing any special troubleshooting.     A red circle indicates the Loop has not completed in over 15 minutes.  This is not a typical state, and you should troubleshoot why Loop is not completing.  Please review the  Yellow and Red Loop troubleshooting page  for tips on how to get your green Loop back.  Clicking on the red circle will also pop-up the last error message to help guide your troubleshooting.

Click on the that line and you will be able to change the name of your RileyLink. The new name may need to sit for a few seconds before exiting back out of the naming screen for it to save itself. RileyLink must be connected and on to change the name.\n\n\nDepending on which pump you have connected to your Loop app, your RL menu will look different. On the left below is the typical RL menu when using Medtronic pump, and on the right is with an Omnipod. As you can see, both have in common a section called \"Device\", but after that only the Medtronic pumps will have additional commands in the RileyLink menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevice\n\u2301\n\n\nThe settings under the Device section are mostly for your information only. The two most important lines are the Connection Status and Signal Strength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Connections Status should say \nconnected\n if the RileyLink is connected to the iPhone's Bluetooth. If the status says \nconnecting\n or \ndisconnected\n then you should toggle the iPhone's BT and/or RileyLink's power switch off/on to help reconnect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Signal Strength is the strength of the Bluetooth signal between the iPhone and RileyLink.  It is \nnot\n the signal strength of the radio communications with the pump/pod.  The lower the number, the stronger the connection. As you move the RL and iPhone closer/farther apart, you will be able to see the signal strength change. In a pinch, this can be used to help locate a lost RileyLink in the house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPump\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Pump ID and Pump Model will be automatically filled in from your pump. \n\n\nCommands\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are several commands that the RileyLink can issue to a Medtronic pump. Most are simply for gathering information from the pump.\n\n\nTune Radio Frequency\n\u2301\n\n\nThe pump and RileyLink communicate via radio frequency. In order to have the best possible communications, RileyLink will test a range of frequencies in order to see which provides the strongest response with the pump. In the event that pump comms fail for over 14 minutes, Loop will automatically retune the RileyLink to see if perhaps the strongest frequency has changed since it was last tuned.\n\n\nWhen you first setup your Loop app, RileyLink will automatically perform a \nTune Radio Frequency\n to get pump comms started. You can manually tune your radio frequency at any time by clicking on the command. It may take about a minute, but soon you will see a list of frequencies with the tuning strength results beside each frequency. The signal with the lowest value is the strongest and RileyLink will use that frequency. Exit out of that screen and the command line will now show the frequency (916.xx MHz for North American pumps) and the timestamp of the tune.\n\n\n\n\nA common troubleshooting recommendation is to tune your RL when you have poor pump communications. Just keep in mind that the Loop code has a function that it will automatically retune in the event of poor pump communications within 14 minutes. Loop does this automatically.  Manually retuning is only useful for impatience purposes. If Loop has failed longer than 20 minutes, it will have already likely tried a retune...but knock yourself out if you want to try it again manually.\n\n\n\n\nChange Time\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop automatically prompts you to set your pump time using the Loop app as part of initial Loop setup.  It is important that Loop and your pump share a common time setting, otherwise Looping will fail.  If you are traveling through timezones or dealing with daylight savings time, please read up on \nhow to safely change your pump time\n.\n\n\n\n\nAlways use the RileyLink's \nChange Time\n command to change pump time.  If you fail to set the pump time by using the RileyLink, Loop will not function properly.  Do not use the pump menus to change your pump's time when Looping.\n\n\n\n\nOther commands\n\u2301\n\n\nMySentry Pair, Fetch Recent History, Fetch Enlite Glucose, Get Pump Model, Send Button Press, Read Pump Status, and Read Basal Schedule are all ways of asking the pump for information you might be interested in. They are not part of setting up the Loop and will not affect Loop operations. Enable Diagnostic LEDs, Discover Commands, and RileyLink Statistics are commands that are sometimes used by developers to aid in app troubleshooting and debugging. They don't impact Loop operations.\n\n\nMySentry Pair\n is for x23 and x54 pumps only, and you will have completed this pairing command as part of the original \nAdd Pump\n process. The MySentry pairing process adds a specific ID to your pump in the pump's Connect Devices, Other Devices menu. This pairing allows Loop to get information from x23 and x54 in an efficient manner. If that is not done, Loop will only be green every other loop. If you ever want to re-pair MySentry, you can follow the directions as shown in the RileyLink command screen. You do not have to worry about this command if you are using an x15 or x22 model pump, as they do not have MySentry.\n\n\nFetch Recent History\n polls the pump for recent pump events such as boluses, temp basals, primes, rewinds, etc.  The amount of information transmitted for a Fetch Recent History is usually quite large and, as a result, may be more prone to an early failure before it succeeds. If the first Fetch Recent History fails, sometimes it is helpful to use the Send Button Press command to sort of \"wake up\" the pump in preparation for communications.\n\n\nFetch Enlite Glucose\n is only useful for Medtronic CGM users. The Fetch Enlite Glucose command will pull the recent glucose values saved in the pump history. Dexcom users do not store any glucose data in the pump.\n\n\nGet Pump Model\n simply returns the pump's model.\n\n\nSend Button Press\n can be useful to see if the communication between the RileyLink and pump is working. If successful, the screen on the pump will light up and Loop will confirm the button press with a \nsuccess\n message. If pump comms are failing, sending a successful button press can help \"wake up\" a pump that perhaps has not been communicating well.\n\n\nRead Pump Status\n is also nice quick pump read for reservoir volume, pump battery voltage, and pump status (bolusing or suspending). For x23 and x54 pump users, this command will provide the exact pump battery voltage instead of the 25/50/75/100% levels that are reported otherwise.\n\n\nRead Basal Schedule\n will pull the active basal pattern from the pump so you can review what the current settings are without using pump menu.\n\n\nEnable Diagnostic LEDs\n will turn on more LED flashes on the RileyLink while it is operating. You will see more blue flashing lights as the RileyLink communicates with the pump. If you tried turning on this feature and decide later that you just don't want to see so many flashing lights, simply reboot the RileyLink by turning the power switch off/on.  This will reset the LEDs.\n\n\nDiscover Commands\n just ignore this menu item.\n\n\nRileyLink Statistics\n tracks how long your RileyLink has stayed successfully operating and gives the developers some useful information about the stability of the RL operations. It really doesn't provide much to the average Loop user, however.",

In order to have the best possible communications, RileyLink will test a range of frequencies in order to see which provides the strongest response with the pump. In the event that pump comms fail for over 14 minutes, Loop will automatically retune the RileyLink to see if perhaps the strongest frequency has changed since it was last tuned.  When you first setup your Loop app, RileyLink will automatically perform a  Tune Radio Frequency  to get pump comms started. You can manually tune your radio frequency at any time by clicking on the command. It may take about a minute, but soon you will see a list of frequencies with the tuning strength results beside each frequency. The signal with the lowest value is the strongest and RileyLink will use that frequency. Exit out of that screen and the command line will now show the frequency (916.xx MHz for North American pumps) and the timestamp of the tune.   A common troubleshooting recommendation is to tune your RL when you have poor pump communications. Just keep in mind that the Loop code has a function that it will automatically retune in the event of poor pump communications within 14 minutes. Loop does this automatically.  Manually retuning is only useful for impatience purposes.

They are not part of setting up the Loop and will not affect Loop operations. Enable Diagnostic LEDs, Discover Commands, and RileyLink Statistics are commands that are sometimes used by developers to aid in app troubleshooting and debugging. They don't impact Loop operations.  MySentry Pair  is for x23 and x54 pumps only, and you will have completed this pairing command as part of the original  Add Pump  process. The MySentry pairing process adds a specific ID to your pump in the pump's Connect Devices, Other Devices menu. This pairing allows Loop to get information from x23 and x54 in an efficient manner. If that is not done, Loop will only be green every other loop. If you ever want to re-pair MySentry, you can follow the directions as shown in the RileyLink command screen. You do not have to worry about this command if you are using an x15 or x22 model pump, as they do not have MySentry.  Fetch Recent History  polls the pump for recent pump events such as boluses, temp basals, primes, rewinds, etc.  The amount of information transmitted for a Fetch Recent History is usually quite large and, as a result, may be more prone to an early failure before it succeeds. If the first Fetch Recent History fails, sometimes it is helpful to use the Send Button Press command to sort of \"wake up\" the pump in preparation for communications.  Fetch Enlite Glucose  is only useful for Medtronic CGM users. The Fetch Enlite Glucose command will pull the recent glucose values saved in the pump history. Dexcom users do not store any glucose data in the pump.  Get Pump Model  simply returns the pump's model.  Send Button Press  can be useful to see if the communication between the RileyLink and pump is working. If successful, the screen on the pump will light up and Loop will confirm the button press with a  success  message. If pump comms are failing, sending a successful button press can help \"wake up\" a pump that perhaps has not been communicating well.  Read Pump Status  is also nice quick pump read for reservoir volume, pump battery voltage, and pump status (bolusing or suspending). For x23 and x54 pump users, this command will provide the exact pump battery voltage instead of the 25/50/75/100% levels that are reported otherwise.  Read Basal Schedule  will pull the active basal pattern from the pump so you can review what the current settings are without using pump menu.  Enable Diagnostic LEDs  will turn on more LED flashes on the RileyLink while it is operating. You will see more blue flashing lights as the RileyLink communicates with the pump. If you tried turning on this feature and decide later that you just don't want to see so many flashing lights, simply reboot the RileyLink by turning the power switch off/on.  This will reset the LEDs.  Discover Commands  just ignore this menu item.  RileyLink Statistics  tracks how long your RileyLink has stayed successfully operating and gives the developers some useful information about the stability of the RL operations.

After a carb entry is saved, Loop will provide a bolus screen with a recommended bolus amount. The only time the bolus screen wouldn't appear is if Loop believes the insulin-on-board is already sufficient to cover the added carbs or you are missing current blood glucose data. If you want to deliver the total amount of the recommended bolus, simply tap on the recommended amount of units and the bolus delivery line will automatically be filled in with the same units. If you want to give fewer units than the recommended amount, you can manually enter the desired amount to be delivered.\n\n\nThe bolus tool will not offer a recommended bolus if your BG is predicted to go below your specified suspend threshold. A screen will appear letting you know the reason no bolus is being recommended, as well as the status of your active COB and IOB. You can choose to override that warning and give a bolus, or treat the low BG and come back to the bolus tool when your BG has recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrection Bolus\n\u2301\n\n\nOccasionally, a recommended bolus will be offered in the bolus tool unrelated to a newly saved carb entry. In those cases, Loop is calculating that it will not be able to stay in the BG correction range through the use of high temp basals alone and is offering a \u201ccorrection bolus\u201d. Correction boluses will not be delivered automatically by Loop, they must be delivered by the user. Loop will also not give an alert when a correction bolus is being offered, the bolus entry tool must be clicked to check for one. The Loop pill in Nightscout will display when Loop has a recommended bolus calculated. In a well-tuned Loop with decent carb counting, correction boluses should be infrequently needed.\n\n\nStarting Bolus Notification\n\u2301\n\n\nA new status line will appear when Loop is sending a bolus command to the pump. Just above the main screen's glucose chart, you will see a \"starting bolus\" indicator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolus Failure Notifications\n\u2301\n\n\nOn occasion, you will receive notification that a bolus may have failed. In some of these cases, the bolus actually will begin delivery. Therefore, you should always check the pump screen to verify the bolus status before attempting to redeliver a failed bolus.\n\n\nSquare or Dual Waves\n\u2301\n\n\nUnfortunately, Loop cannot enact temp basals while the pump is delivering a square- or dual-wave bolus. Therefore, you will need to use alternate bolusing strategies for situation where you would've previously used those extended bolusing techniques.\n\n\nThe good news is that Loop has the only \"smart\" bolus tool available in any DIY or commercial loop. Because you are entering a carb absorption time with each carb entry, Loop is also using that information to predict how well your insulin bolusing and carb absorption will align. So when Loop offers you a bolus, it may actually offer less of a bolus upfront for long, slow-carb meals...and will make up the remaining bolus amount via high temp basals later.\n\n\nIn understanding Loop's smart bolusing, it may help to think back to the reason you originally used square- or dual-wave boluses. Typically, you used those extended bolusing strategies because if you had entered all the insulin, based on carb ratio alone, upfront at the beginning of the meal...you would have gone low shortly after bolusing. The food would simply be absorbing too slow and the whole amount of insulin working too fast...and you'd go low until the rest of the meal would kick in later. The extended bolusing was a way of avoiding the early low and also addressing the later high for meals like pizza or Chinese food.\n\n\nLoop emulates that extended bolusing when you enter long-duration carb absorptions. Let's use an example of a pizza meal where carb ratios alone would've required a 10 unit bolus for the meal.  By telling Loop the meal will take a long (aka 4+ hours) carb absorption time, Loop may only offer 6 units up-front as an initial bolus. After you eat though, Loop knows that it has not provided all the insulin that will be necessary to account for the carbs. Loop will provide the remaining 4 units via high temp basals as soon as predicted BGs are showing that there is no danger of a post-prandial low. In other words, Loop waits until the danger of a quick low is over and then will high temp to cover the late digesting carbs. If you don't want to wait for Loop to deliver the remaining \"second\" bolus via high temps, you can click on the bolus tool when BGs start to rise and deliver the remaining bolus needed. Loop will have a recommended bolus awaiting when the predicted BGs are above correction range.\n\n\nYou can read another example of this extended bolusing technique over on \nLoopTips.org\n.\n\n\nWhile you adapt to new bolusing techniques, it is important to monitor closely to see what works for you. It will take some trial and error to get it right. For meals like Chinese food, where there is a mix of fast carbs and slow carbs, you may want to break the total meal entry into a couple mixed carb entries to help Loop provide the best bolus recommendation upfront. Additionally, some people account for the fats/proteins that digest by adding slow carbs with long absorption times for meals that cause late BG rises.\n\n\nA very useful tool is to check back on your Insulin Counteraction Effects graph to see how your original entry compared to how Loop perceived your final meal impacts. You can read more about that tool \nhere\n.\n\n\nGlucodyn\n\u2301\n\n\nUsing the \nGlucodyn\n model can help you simulate new bolusing strategies.  Glucodyn allows you to simulate your post-prandial BGs based on your particular ISF, carb ratio, and carbs. You can simulate split boluses and watch their impact on simulated BG responses.  The underlying math of the Glucodyn model was the basis of Loop's insulin/carb calculations in early Loop versions. The math has changed since then, however the model still provides a useful visualization about the interactions between DIA, carb absorption times and insulin dosing.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, Loop cannot enact temp basals while the pump is delivering a square- or dual-wave bolus. Therefore, you will need to use alternate bolusing strategies for situation where you would've previously used those extended bolusing techniques.  The good news is that Loop has the only \"smart\" bolus tool available in any DIY or commercial loop. Because you are entering a carb absorption time with each carb entry, Loop is also using that information to predict how well your insulin bolusing and carb absorption will align. So when Loop offers you a bolus, it may actually offer less of a bolus upfront for long, slow-carb meals...and will make up the remaining bolus amount via high temp basals later.  In understanding Loop's smart bolusing, it may help to think back to the reason you originally used square- or dual-wave boluses. Typically, you used those extended bolusing strategies because if you had entered all the insulin, based on carb ratio alone, upfront at the beginning of the meal...you would have gone low shortly after bolusing. The food would simply be absorbing too slow and the whole amount of insulin working too fast...and you'd go low until the rest of the meal would kick in later. The extended bolusing was a way of avoiding the early low and also addressing the later high for meals like pizza or Chinese food.  Loop emulates that extended bolusing when you enter long-duration carb absorptions. Let's use an example of a pizza meal where carb ratios alone would've required a 10 unit bolus for the meal.  By telling Loop the meal will take a long (aka 4+ hours) carb absorption time, Loop may only offer 6 units up-front as an initial bolus. After you eat though, Loop knows that it has not provided all the insulin that will be necessary to account for the carbs. Loop will provide the remaining 4 units via high temp basals as soon as predicted BGs are showing that there is no danger of a post-prandial low. In other words, Loop waits until the danger of a quick low is over and then will high temp to cover the late digesting carbs. If you don't want to wait for Loop to deliver the remaining \"second\" bolus via high temps, you can click on the bolus tool when BGs start to rise and deliver the remaining bolus needed. Loop will have a recommended bolus awaiting when the predicted BGs are above correction range.  You can read another example of this extended bolusing technique over on  LoopTips.org .  While you adapt to new bolusing techniques, it is important to monitor closely to see what works for you. It will take some trial and error to get it right. For meals like Chinese food, where there is a mix of fast carbs and slow carbs, you may want to break the total meal entry into a couple mixed carb entries to help Loop provide the best bolus recommendation upfront. Additionally, some people account for the fats/proteins that digest by adding slow carbs with long absorption times for meals that cause late BG rises.  A very useful tool is to check back on your Insulin Counteraction Effects graph to see how your original entry compared to how Loop perceived your final meal impacts. You can read more about that tool  here .",

Examples where this can be helpful include hormone cycles, steroid medications, exercise, and other situations which may temporarily (either shorter or longer term) affect your underlying insulin needs.\n\n\nOverride presets are (1) optional and (2) can be configured within Loop's workout icon (the little blue heart icon in the Loop toolbar). Once override presets are created, they can be turned on/off by using the workout icon as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow overrides work\n\u2301\n\n\nOverrides allow you to specify an overall insulin needs adjustment, a target range, and a duration for the override with each preset. The overall insulin needs adjustment is an adjustment to your scheduled basal rates, carb ratios, and insulin sensitivities all together. In other words, overall insulin needs percent will affect boluses, temp basals, and correction recommendations.  \n\n\nNotice the fine-print below the orange bar showing the overall adjustment graphic...\"Basal, bolus, and correction insulin dose amounts are increased by 20%\" in the example with a 120% overall insulin needs adjustment. So, 100% overall needs means no multiplier will be applied to your basal, insulin sensitivities, or carb ratio...but you could still use a 100% preset simply to define a different target range for a period of time. \n\n\nRecapping: If you set an overall insulin needs adjustment below 100%, you are telling Loop that you are more insulin sensitive and will need a lighter touch with all things insulin. If you set an overall insulin needs adjustment above 100%, you are telling Loop that you are less insulin sensitive and will need a more aggressive touch with all things insulin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow overrides do NOT work\n\u2301\n\n\nOverrides will work while you are Looping. Sounds obvious, right? But, the thing to remember is that the adjustments (multipliers) that overrides make are not saved back to your Medtronic pump or Omnipod. They only exist in the Loop app.\n\n\n\n\nIf you walk away from iPhone and/or RileyLink...\n\n\nIf you stop Looping (i.e., walk away from your gear), your existing temp basal will complete the remainder of whatever is left of its original 30 minutes and you will return to scheduled basal rates AS DEFINED IN YOUR LOOP SETTINGS. Your adjusted needs as set-up in any override will not continue if your Loop is not running properly. So you cannot set a 50% override and then hop in the ocean for a 2-mile swim without your iPhone and RileyLink and expect decreased basals of 50%. Just be aware that in situations where you need prolonged lower basals while away from Looping gear, you will need to edit your scheduled basals.\n\n\n\n\nOverrides also should not be used as a temporary sledgehammer to force Loop into an immediate suspend. There have been users, for example, setting a 10% override to force Loop to suspend. Then they've decided to manually bolus for food during the time that override is active. Loop will be assuming you only need 10% of your usual insulin needs...so the insulin you delivered to cover the meal will be perceived as ridiculously too much and your predicted BG curve will turn very, very low for the next 6 hours or so. Instead of trying to use a 10% override to force Loop into a suspend, you are better off simply issuing a suspend command to the pod and setting a reminder in your phone to resume insulin deliver later. Another option would be (assuming you aren't going out for a swim away from your Loop gear)...just let Loop do its thing and suspend insulin delivery via temp basals as needed.\n\n\nMaking your override presets\n\u2301\n\n\nTo make your override presets, simply tap on the workout icon.

If you do not enter a target range, Loop will use your existing scheduled target ranges.\n\n\nSelect whether you want the override to run indefinitely or for a finite time.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you've made all those adjustments, save the the preset using the \"Save\" button in the upper right corner.\n\n\nActivating your override\n\u2301\n\n\nTo enact your override preset, you simply tap on the workout icon toolbar and select your override from your list of presets that you programmed in previously in the step above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heart will be highlighted in a blue square while active and a banner notification will appear at the top of the Loop's main screen. Additionally, you'll see a darker blue target area indicating the override's target range and duration in your Loop's blood glucose graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also setup a future start time for the override by selecting the override preset and setting the \"Start time\" row. Save the future override by pressing the \"Enable\" button in the top right corner. A future override can be very helpful, for example, to set an exercise override the night before your workout. Set your exercise override to activate 2 hours before you wake up for your 5am spin class in the morning. You'll wake up with less insulin on board and at your desired exercise targets, without needing to set an alarm to wake up simply to set an override.\n\n\nDeactivating your override\n\u2301\n\n\nThis is simple...just tap the heart icon to turn off your override at any time. Override presets that have been programmed with a finite duration will automatically deactivate when their time's duration reaches the end.\n\n\nRemote overrides\n\u2301\n\n\nYou can also use your Nightscout site to activate/deactivate your Loop's override presets.

At the top of the page is a useful graphic called Insulin Counteraction Effects (ICE for short).  What is it?  Basically, a graphical representation of \npredicted\n upward-BG effects vs. \nencountered\n upward-BG effects.\n\n\nConsider the possible sources of triggers that counteract insulin (in other words, make BGs go up)\n\n\n\n\nfood\n\n\nstress\n\n\nillness\n\n\nsomeone sat too close to you\n\n\n\n\nAs we all know, this list can be long but, on \"normal\" days FOOD will be the single strongest \"insulin counteracter\".  Food will be the most influence on making BGs go up.  There are also other reasons that BGs climb when we may have expected them to be steady; basals being set too low, failed infusion site, etc.\n\n\nIf we assume that it's a \"normal\" day (basals are close to correct, illness is not an issue, the site is good), Loop will expect most of the UPWARD pressure on BGs are from food.  Loop is calling that upward pressure Insulin Counteraction Effect (ICE).  This is a pretty reasonable assumption so let's use that for the rest of this discussion.\n\n\nICE display\n\u2301\n\n\nLet's take a look at an example day using the screenshot below.  The graph at the top of your ICE page represents that upward pressure Loop expects from the food entries.  The predicted ICE is shown as grey bars.  As a meal is tracked by Loop, you'll see green bars of observed ICE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you make a food entry originally, Loop will save your entry as you've made it.  On the line below your original entry, Loop will also start tracking your food entry assuming a 1.5 times longer carb absorption time.  This helps Loop track carbs that may actually be absorbing longer than you expected (part of that whole dynamic carb absorption modeling).  Loop will be updating that value of \"observed\" carb absorption time as well as absorbed carbs as your meal goes on.\n\n\nPractical use\n\u2301\n\n\nSo how can we use this information to make our Looping experience better?  The answer is probably best illustrated using a real-world example.  Chinese food...in fact, THIS Chinese dish.  General Tso's chicken.  As you can see in the recipe, loads of fast carbs with ingredients like hoisin sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch.  But also slower carbs like chicken.  Rice can be a difficult one because for us, it acts fast but also seems to have a long tail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a busy day and I really didn't want to count carbs.  Ok, even on the slow days I don't want to count carbs.  I just eyeballed the bowl of food and guessed.  As I entered the food in originally, I was still trying to come up with a good guess on the ratio of fast:slow carbs but kid was in a hurry to eat.  My initial guess around 3:30pm was 70g of carbs at 5 hours absorption (note: it gets edited to 80g in a little bit), we bolused for that and she started to eat.  About 10 minutes later, I decided to add 10g of fast-acting carbs at 1-hour absorption to help with the sauce's speedy carbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatching what was going on a little later...BGs were rising at a decent clip and I had a feeling I really didn't cover things super well...so I edited the original 70g entry, adding 10g and making it 80g instead.  (That's why there is a 2U bolus around 4:20pm.)  And of course around 5:40pm there was a little bit of nibbling on the leftovers as we put them into the fridge.  We gave 10g for that.  BGs climbed a bit more, not surprising given how we were underestimating fast carbs at this point...but still not so bad at 180 peak BG.  (Anna gave 2 units correction at the peak because there was dessert coming later that night and she wanted to be ready for it without too much pre-bolus.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, how can I use the ICE info to make this meal better?  I can look at the observed ICE information and the observed carb entry Loop has recorded to adjust my insulin bolusing the next time we eat this meal.\n\n\nFor example, the biggest weakness I had in this (and suspected it even as I did the initial bolus) was that I underestimated the sauce's fast carbs.  I can see this in the observed ICE graph having the early green peaks after the meal, and in the way that the observed carb distribution was more like 7:2 vs my original guess of 8:1 (slow:fast carbs).  Overall, it appears that I guess on overall carb content pretty closely (90g vs. 89g observed).  Next time we have General Tso's chicken, I will likely bolus it as 70g at 5 hours and 20g at 2 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo remember to check your ICE page at the end of a meal's absorption.  By checking in on the meal's observed behaviors, you'll have a good starting point to fine-tuning any new or unknown carb breakdown.\n\n\nSide note:  remember this conversation is assuming you have basals fairly well set and are not sick.  If other factors could be significantly causing your BGs to swing that Loop doesn't know about (bad sites, illness, or basal rates that need to be adjusted), they may be attributed to ICE when they really aren't food-related.

But also slower carbs like chicken.  Rice can be a difficult one because for us, it acts fast but also seems to have a long tail.     It was a busy day and I really didn't want to count carbs.  Ok, even on the slow days I don't want to count carbs.  I just eyeballed the bowl of food and guessed.  As I entered the food in originally, I was still trying to come up with a good guess on the ratio of fast:slow carbs but kid was in a hurry to eat.  My initial guess around 3:30pm was 70g of carbs at 5 hours absorption (note: it gets edited to 80g in a little bit), we bolused for that and she started to eat.

            "text": "Pump Battery\n\u2301\n\n\nOne common confusion point for new Loop users is how to interpret their pump's battery levels and whether they need to change their pump batteries based on which pieces of information.\n\n\nDischarge Curves\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are generally two different types of AAA batteries that we use in these Medtronic pumps; alkaline or lithium.\n\n\nTo understand pump battery levels, you first need to know a little about \nbattery discharge curves\n.  It's not a hard concept...basically how a battery dies over time as it is used or sits in a drawer.  More technically said, a battery discharge curve is the measure of volts that a battery puts out over time.  Batteries start at a higher voltage output and slowly that voltage output degrades over time (or use) until the battery no longer provides enough \"ummph\" to keep the electronic gadget going.  BUT, alkaline batteries and lithium batteries have different discharge curves due to the chemistry inside them, and the curves can be slightly different depending on the environment (temperature) and battery manufacturer.\n\n\nAlkaline batteries have a relatively steady voltage drop over time, as shown below.  Notice the shape of the curve has a significant amount of time in the 1.3 to 1.2 volts range, and a relatively smooth decline to about 1.2 volts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLithium batteries have a much steadier voltage output over time, as shown below.  Notice how the shape of the curve is relatively flat for a large portion of the battery life before suddenly off around 1.3 volts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the above information mean in terms of Looping?  A lithium battery at 1.3v is going to have a much quicker time to death than an alkaline battery sitting at 1.3v.  You might only get a couple of hours of looping left when a lithium battery is at 1.3v, but an alkaline battery at 1.3v might go for several more days.  So when we talk about setting alarm levels in either system, your battery type is an important consideration.\n\n\nMedtronic Pump Battery Level Indicator\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you read Medtronic's literature, it will tell you to use Energizer alkaline batteries in their pumps.  Why would that be?  Hint: the answer doesn't mean that Duracell batteries are inherently worse than Energizer or that lithium batteries won't work in Medtronic pumps.\n\n\nThe answer is all about the accuracy of their little pump battery level indicator on their pump's screen.\n  Medtronic calibrated their pump battery level indicator to:\n\n\n\n\nEnergizer alkaline batteries\n\n\nNormal (non-Loop) uses\n\n\nTemperatures between 37\u00b0F (3\u00b0C) to 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C).\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, Medtronic ran experiments to see exactly how long an Energizer alkaline battery will last in normal pump use and made their own discharge curve.  They programmed their pump battery level indicator to change from 4 bars to 3 bars to 2 bars to 1 bar based on that particular discharge curve.\n\n\nHowever, Loop users are slightly more demanding on the pump's battery/voltage than simply delivering insulin.  We are also asking for the pump to perform radio communications, in addition to delivering insulin.  Those radio communications needs a slightly higher voltage than the typical \"normal\" pump use.  So while a non-Looper might be ok running their pump until a voltage of about 1.12 for insulin delivery, radio communications might stop at a voltage output of about 1.17.  If you experiment with your Looping pump, you'll find Loop will turn red from failed pump comms before the pump actually fails at insulin delivery.  This difference between \"failure\" voltages needs to be considered when determining how much useful battery life is left for a pump battery.\n\n\nIn summary, that little pump battery indicator on the Medtronic pump screen is ONLY useful if you are:\n\n\n\n\nnot using the pump for Looping,\n\n\nusing Energizer alkaline batteries, and\n\n\nin the temperature environment similar to their testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop users should not rely on their Medtronic pump screen's pump battery indicator, and instead use the Loop's pump battery level indicator.\n\n\n\n\nLoop's Pump Battery Level Indicator\n\u2301\n\n\nKeeping the information about battery discharge curves in mind, Loop developers tested various battery brands and types to develop discharge curves for Loop users.  These discharge curves form the basis of the pump battery level indicator found in the top right of the Loop's main display screen and the pump battery notifications provided by the Loop app.  The pump battery level indicator will also report in %.\n\n\n\n\nFor x23 and x54 model users, the Loop's pump battery level will move in 25% increments.\n\n\nFor x15 and x22 model users, the Loop's pump battery level will move in discrete % increments.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the battery type selected and the pump model being used, the Loop's pump battery level notifications are designed to give the user about 8 hours of notice before pump communications are likely to fail.  The Loop user should have some additional time after pump comms fail before actual insulin delivery would stop.\n\n\nNightscout Pump Battery Display\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Nightscout information regarding pump battery levels will depend on pump model being used.\n\n\n\n\nIf you use an x23 or x54 pump and MySentry, the pump levels are reported as a \npercent\n to NS, because that's how MySentry reports the data to Loop.  The packets use 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% increments, and the Loop's main display matches the NS pump display.\n\n\nIf you use an x22 or x15 pump, the pump levels are reported as \nvoltage\n readings to NS because Loop has to specifically request the voltage reading from the pump.  The Loop's main display will show pump battery level as discrete %, not the individual voltage measurement.\n\n\nNo matter what pump you are using, you can always get the current pump battery's voltage by using the RileyLink's \nRead Pump Status\n command.\n\n\nThe extra communications effort for non-MySentry model pumps will mean slightly shorter battery life vs. MySentry model pumps.\n\n\n\n\nNightscout Pump Battery Alarms\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Nightscout alarms are based on the Heroku settings that you have input specifically.  If you don't specifically set them, Nightscout will use the default settings for pump battery alerts as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNightscout pump battery levels, if you leave things at default installation, will not trigger alarms.  If however you add a setting of \nPUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS\n to \ntrue\n, you will receive pump battery notifications according to the levels shown in the parenthesis above.  For example, your x23 pump is reporting its levels in percent, therefore you'd receive a yellow warning alarm at 30% and an urgent red alarm at 20%.

            "text": "There are generally two different types of AAA batteries that we use in these Medtronic pumps; alkaline or lithium.  To understand pump battery levels, you first need to know a little about  battery discharge curves .  It's not a hard concept...basically how a battery dies over time as it is used or sits in a drawer.  More technically said, a battery discharge curve is the measure of volts that a battery puts out over time.  Batteries start at a higher voltage output and slowly that voltage output degrades over time (or use) until the battery no longer provides enough \"ummph\" to keep the electronic gadget going.  BUT, alkaline batteries and lithium batteries have different discharge curves due to the chemistry inside them, and the curves can be slightly different depending on the environment (temperature) and battery manufacturer.  Alkaline batteries have a relatively steady voltage drop over time, as shown below.  Notice the shape of the curve has a significant amount of time in the 1.3 to 1.2 volts range, and a relatively smooth decline to about 1.2 volts.     Lithium batteries have a much steadier voltage output over time, as shown below.  Notice how the shape of the curve is relatively flat for a large portion of the battery life before suddenly off around 1.3 volts.     What does the above information mean in terms of Looping?  A lithium battery at 1.3v is going to have a much quicker time to death than an alkaline battery sitting at 1.3v.  You might only get a couple of hours of looping left when a lithium battery is at 1.3v, but an alkaline battery at 1.3v might go for several more days.  So when we talk about setting alarm levels in either system, your battery type is an important consideration.",

            "text": "If you read Medtronic's literature, it will tell you to use Energizer alkaline batteries in their pumps.  Why would that be?  Hint: the answer doesn't mean that Duracell batteries are inherently worse than Energizer or that lithium batteries won't work in Medtronic pumps.  The answer is all about the accuracy of their little pump battery level indicator on their pump's screen.   Medtronic calibrated their pump battery level indicator to:   Energizer alkaline batteries  Normal (non-Loop) uses  Temperatures between 37\u00b0F (3\u00b0C) to 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C).   In other words, Medtronic ran experiments to see exactly how long an Energizer alkaline battery will last in normal pump use and made their own discharge curve.  They programmed their pump battery level indicator to change from 4 bars to 3 bars to 2 bars to 1 bar based on that particular discharge curve.  However, Loop users are slightly more demanding on the pump's battery/voltage than simply delivering insulin.  We are also asking for the pump to perform radio communications, in addition to delivering insulin.  Those radio communications needs a slightly higher voltage than the typical \"normal\" pump use.  So while a non-Looper might be ok running their pump until a voltage of about 1.12 for insulin delivery, radio communications might stop at a voltage output of about 1.17.  If you experiment with your Looping pump, you'll find Loop will turn red from failed pump comms before the pump actually fails at insulin delivery.  This difference between \"failure\" voltages needs to be considered when determining how much useful battery life is left for a pump battery.  In summary, that little pump battery indicator on the Medtronic pump screen is ONLY useful if you are:   not using the pump for Looping,  using Energizer alkaline batteries, and  in the temperature environment similar to their testing.    Loop users should not rely on their Medtronic pump screen's pump battery indicator, and instead use the Loop's pump battery level indicator.",

When you are operating in open-loop mode, Loop is offering recommendations for temp basals and will display them on the main screen.  The recommendations will not be enacted unless you specifically choose to enact the temp basal.  Usually in open-loop mode, you aren't really enacting the recommended basals but instead watching how the recommendations come in and figuring out WHY they are being recommended.\n\n\nIt is understandable to want to jump straight away into close-loop mode, but a lot can be learned by watching Loop operate in open mode.  Becoming familiar with the algorithm can be easier by watching it in action rather than only reading about it in docs.\n\n\nTesting\n\u2301\n\n\nA great benefit of open-loop mode is that you can establish a baseline of BG trends without the influence of temp basals from Loop.  This is particularly helpful if you haven't used Medtronic sites/pumps prior to Loop.  You may find that your basal rates change significantly coming from other brands of pumps.  Taking the time to establish a good Medtronic pump basal profile will set you up for a smoother transition to close-loop mode.  Test your ISF during open-loop time too, as ISF is an important component for every Loop calculation for temp basals.  Every 5 minutes, Loop uses your ISF...so it's worth testing it ahead of close-loop mode.\n\n\nEventual BG\n\u2301\n\n\nOne of the best things you can do is to train yourself to watch the eventual BG rather than the current BG for helping understand Loop recommendations for temp basals.  So many of us have become accustomed to dealing with current BGs and perhaps IOB at the same time...but Loop is also looking at BG momentum, carbs on board, retrospective trends.  Loop is utilizing all of those variables to predict an eventual BG.  Its current decisions are based on that eventual BG.  Training yourself to watch that eventual BG will help you understand the temp basals being offered at any given time.\n\n\nCarb Absorption\n\u2301\n\n\nProbably the next most difficult transition involves using carb absorption as a component to every meal bolus.  Understand that the default carb absorption times in Loop may not work for your particular body.  Similar to how you perhaps had used extended boluses for meals that impacted BGs longer than the duration of your insulin...that same idea applies to estimate your carb absorption times.  Watch your meals and try to estimate how long they are impacting your BG for various types of food.  Watch the times when Loop would've wanted to suspend or high temp basal...ask yourself why it would be doing that.  Especially ask yourself if that is the same decision as you would've made at that time in a meal normally.  Would you be worried that you might go low later if you see Loop offering high temp basal early after a meal?  Would you be worried about going high later if Loop wants to suspend basals instead?  If you put some effort into this effort before closing the loop, it will pay off with a smoother transition to closed loop.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\u2301\n\n\nGet used to carrying the RileyLink around.  Find how far your connectivity stretches before you have pump communication problems.  Get used to troubleshooting yellow and red loops, finding out the pattern/cause of any potential loop issues.  You'll be less frustrated starting on closed loop if you aren't dealing with learning new electronics at the same time as you are learning carb absorption times in a closed loop.  Learn how to retune your RL. \n\n\nBolus\n\u2301\n\n\nBolus meals from the Loop, rather than the pump.  Become familiar with entering carbs into the Loop app, as well as editing them.  Watch how long it takes for Loop app to display the bolus after you enact it (hint: there's a delay until the bolus finishes delivery and the pump gets read).  Familiarize yourself with the \"Bolus May Have Failed\" notifications and how to handle them.  Double-check the pump and verify that the bolus didn't enact before trying to give the bolus again.  \n\n\nCaregiver training\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you are the parent or guardian of a t1d kid using Loop, make sure you take the time to educate caregivers around your family and school for how to use Loop.  Perhaps you want to draft individualized quick info sheets for those caregivers to use with Loop.

            "text": "Blood Glucose Prediction\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop uses an algorithm to maintain blood glucose in a correction range by predicting the contributions from four individual effects (insulin, carbohydrates, retrospective correction, and blood glucose momentum) at any time \nt\n to recommend temporary basal rate corrections and boluses. \n\n\n\n\nYou can see the individual contributions of these effects by tapping on the predicted blood glucose chart on Loop's status screen. Loop updates this blood glucose prediction every five minutes when a new CGM value has been received and the pump's status has been updated.\n\n\nJust a note, this whole section is fairly technical. While perhaps not the most interesting topic for many readers, if you are seeking the detailed view of the Loop algorithm this discussion is quite useful. If you want a more surface understanding, the overview and temporary basal recommendations sections alone are probably sufficient.\n\n\nOverview\n\u2301\n\n\nBefore we delve into each of the four individual effects, a general overview figure may be a helpful start. There are four effects summed together to produce Loop's final predicted blood glucose curve. Each individual effect, along with their combined effect, is illustrated in the figure below. Insulin, from boluses and temporary basals, will have a decreasing effect on the prediction. Carbohydrates will have an increasing effect on the prediction. Blood glucose momentum effect can have a positive or negative effect, depending on how blood glucose is trending in the most recent CGM values. As shown in the example below, blood glucose is trending slightly upwards at the time of the prediction. Therefore, the blood glucose momentum effect\u2019s contribution is pulling up the overall prediction from the other three effects for a short time. Retrospective correction is having a decreasing effect on the prediction, indicating that the recent rise in blood glucose was not as large as had been previously predicted by Loop in the recent past. \n\n\n\n\nThe sections below provide detailed information on each of the four contributions. \n\n\nInsulin Effect\n\u2301\n\n\nMost traditional pump users and caregivers are already familiar with the concept of an insulin activity curve, where the insulin\u2019s effect is time-dependent. Insulin takes a little while to affect blood glucose. The insulin effect typically peaks around one hour after giving insulin and then gradually decays. \n\n\n\n\nLoop provides users with two different classes of insulin models (i.e., an exponential model and the Walsh model). All of the exponential models have an insulin activity duration of 6 hours, whereas the insulin activity duration is customizable for the Walsh model. The rapid-acting and Fiasp insulin activity curves are modeled as exponential curves that match the shape of the insulin activity curves from insulin labeling, and as observed in both adults and children.\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of insulin effect remaining, or percent of remaining active insulin after an insulin bolus is delivered, is modeled mathematically in Loop with an exponential decay curve.\n\n\nInsulin Effect Remaining\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nIf a user\u2019s insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) is 50 mg/dL per 1 unit of insulin and the user gives 2 units of insulin, then the user\u2019s blood glucose would be expected to drop 100 mg/dL within the 6 hours following the insulin delivery. This insulin effect can be visualized in several different ways: the expected active insulin, expected drop in blood glucose every 5 minutes after delivery, and the expected cumulative drop in blood glucose. The figures below use the Rapid Acting - Adult insulin model in Loop.\n\n\nActive Insulin\n\u2301\n\n\nThis figure shows that 2 units of insulin are given initially, and the corresponding active insulin (i.e., insulin on board IOB) decays according to the curve below. \n\n\n\n\nThe active insulin at any time is the product of original insulin delivered and the percent of insulin activity remaining. Knowing the expected active insulin over the next 6 hours, and the insulin sensitivity factor (50 mg/dL, in this case), Loop can calculate the expected drop in blood glucose from that dose of insulin as shown in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: ISF is also a function of time, which means if the user\u2019s scheduled ISF changes during the insulin activity time, it will change the expected drop in blood glucose due to the insulin effect. \n\n\nExpected Change in Blood Glucose\n\u2301\n\n\nLastly, taking the first derivative (i.e., the rate of change) of the cumulative drop in the blood glucose curve yields the expected change in blood glucose over the insulin activity duration. For each dose of insulin given, Loop calculates the expected discrete drop in blood glucose at each 5-minute period for the insulin activity duration, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\nInsulin Effect on Blood Glucose\n\u2301\n\n\nFor this example, assuming a user\u2019s blood glucose was 205 mg/dL at the time of insulin delivery, Loop would predict a drop in blood glucose due to the two units delivered at 12 pm as shown in the figure below. \n\n\n\n\nScheduled Basal Rates\n\u2301\n\n\nIn traditional basal/bolus pump therapy, basal rates are set to accommodate the user's endogenous glucose production (EGP) that causes blood glucose to rise. If a user's basal settings were exactly right in traditional pump therapy, the user would have perfectly flat blood glucose all day, all other factors being equal.\n\n\nIn reality, people with type 1 diabetes, and their caregivers, know that basal settings are never exactly right. Every day is a little different, and a myriad of factors that affect blood glucose (e.g., including stress, hormones, sleep, etc.) may affect insulin needs. Some people have different basal profiles to accommodate these variations. Some people regularly tune and adjust their basal rates, and/or do so at their endocrinology clinic visits.\n\n\nSince the Loop algorithm assumes that the user-set basal rates are correct, it calculates the effect of insulin relative to scheduled basal rates. If basal rates are not entirely correct, Loop can compensate a bit through the retrospective correction and blood glucose momentum effects, discussed later in this page.\n\n\nThe insulin delivery chart below displays a bar-graph history of the temporary basal rates enacted by Loop. The display is relative to the scheduled basal rates entered in the Loop settings. A rate displayed in this chart as +0 would indicate that no temporary basal rate was set and that the basal rate being delivered was the scheduled basal rate. Positive values indicate a temporary basal rate was set above the scheduled basal rate (i.e., more insulin delivered), and negative values indicate that a temporary basal rate was set below the scheduled basal rate (i.e., less insulin delivered).\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if the user\u2019s scheduled basal rate is 1 U/hr, and Loop gives a temporary basal rate of 3 U/hr, then it will calculate the expected drop in blood glucose due to +2 U/hr of insulin.\n\n\nSimilarly if Loop sets a temporary basal rate of 0 U/hr for 1 hour, then the insulin effect will also be relative to the current scheduled basal rate of 1 U/hr, and Loop would predict the user\u2019s blood glucose to increase by the amount of change from -1 U/hr of insulin. If the user\u2019s ISF is 50 mg/dL, then Loop would predict blood glucose to rise 50 mg/dL over the insulin activity duration (6 hours). \n\n\nHere is a real-world example where Loop is setting many temporary basal rates over the course of the day. The light orange bars are the temporary basal rates delivered and the solid orange line is the active insulin at any given time during the day.  \n\n\n\n\nTotal Insulin Effect (combining boluses and temporary basal rates)\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop will combine or stack the active insulin of all the discrete (individual) boluses and temporary basal rates over the past insulin activity duration (6 hours), to predict the active insulin for the next 6 hours. As demonstrated above, using the predicted active insulin Loop can predict the blood glucose drop over the next 6 hours. \n\n\nLastly, the combined effect of bolus and basal insulin are visually represented for the user by Loop\u2019s insulin charts:\n\n\n\n\nThe insulin effect can be expressed mathematically:\n\n\n\n\nwhere BG is the expected change in blood glucose with the units (mg/dL/5min), ISF is the insulin sensitivity factor (mg/dL/U) at time t, and IA is the insulin activity (U/5min) at time \nt\n. Insulin activity can also be thought of as a velocity or rate of change in blood glucose due to insulin. The insulin activity accounts for the EGP and any active insulin from basals and boluses.\n\n\nCarbohydrate Effect\n\u2301\n\n\nCarbohydrates will raise blood glucose, but the speed and degree to which they impact blood glucose are dependent on the type of carbohydrates. High glycemic index (GI) carbohydrates will raise blood glucose quickly over a shorter time, whereas low GI foods will raise blood glucose more slowly over a longer period. Foods like candy, juice, and fruits tend to be high GI foods, while pizza, burritos, and quesadillas are usually lower GI foods. Digestion issues like gastroparesis may also contribute to variations in carbohydrate absorption.\n\n\nBecause carbohydrate absorption can be quite variable, Loop has a model that dynamically adjusts the expected remaining time of carbohydrate absorption. To start with, Loop allows the user to input a rough guess of how long they think the food or drink will take to absorb. The user\u2019s guess is used as a middle of the road estimate, and Loop\u2019s algorithm will shorten or lengthen it based on observed blood glucose change.\n\n\nFor all carbohydrate entries, Loop assumes carbohydrates will not start absorbing for 10 minutes, so there is a 10-minute period of no absorption that is modeled prior to the absorption modeled in the next sections.\n\n\nLinear Carbohydrate Absorption\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop takes a conservative view of how fast the remaining carbohydrates will absorb.  Because it is safer to under-deliver insulin for long-duration meals, Loop starts out at a minimum rate of absorption based on extending the entered carbohydrate duration by 50%. Said another way, the minimum carbohydrate absorption rate is the total number of grams of carbohydrates over 150% of the entered duration. \n\n\nUsing this initial minimum absorption rate, the remaining carbohydrates are modeled to absorb linearly. For example, if the user enters a 72g carbohydrate meal, and selects an estimated absorption time of 4 hours, then Loop will forecast a 12g/hr absorption rate for the next 6 hours. This rate can be termed the minimum absorption rate, which can be represented mathematically as:\n\n\n\n\nwhere MAR is the minimum absorption rate (g/hr), CA is the number of carbohydrates (g) and d is the expected duration (hr) it will take the carbohydrates to absorb. \n\n\nDynamic Carbohydrate Absorption\n\u2301\n\n\nThe linear model above is modulated by an additional calculation that uses recently observed blood glucose data to estimate how fast carbohydrates have been absorbing. The expected change in blood glucose due to insulin effects alone is compared to the actual observed changes in blood glucose. This difference is termed the insulin counteraction effect (ICE):\n\n\n\n\nwhere, ICE (mg/dL/5 min) is the insulin counteraction effect, OA is the observed activity (mg/dL/5min) or observed change in blood glucose at time \nt\n, and IA is the insulin activity (mg/dL/5min). \n\n\nInsulin counteraction effects are caused by more than just carbohydrates, and can include exercise, sensitivity changes, or incorrectly configured insulin delivery settings (e.g., basal rate, ISF, etc.). However, since the effect of carbohydrates is often dominant (after insulin), Loop can still make useful ongoing adjustments to its carbohydrate model by assuming that the increase in blood glucose is mainly carbohydrate absorption in the period following recorded meal entries.  \n\n\nThe insulin counteraction effect is converted into an estimated carbohydrate absorption amount by using the current carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio and the insulin sensitivity factor at the time of the recorded meal entry.\n\n\n\n\nwhere AC is the number of carbohydrates absorbed (g/5min), ICE is the insulin counteraction effect, CIR is the carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio (g/U), and ISF is the insulin sensitivity factor (mg/dL/U) at time \nt\n. \n\n\nIf multiple meal entries are active (i.e., still absorbing), the estimated absorption is split between each carbohydrate entry in proportion to each carbohydrate entry\u2019s minimum absorption rate. For example, if 72g carbohydrates with an expected absorption time of 4 hours was consumed at 12 pm, and another 72g of carbohydrates with an expected absorption time of 2 hours was consumed at 3 pm, then the minimum absorption rate (see MAR equation above) would be 12 g/hr and 6 g/hr respectively, or 1 g/5min and 0.5 g/5min.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamining just the simple linear carbohydrate effect of these two meals:\n\n\n\n\nIf we further expand this example, by assuming the following at 4pm:\n\n\n\n\nthat there are still carbohydrates left to be absorbed from both meals, \n\n\nthat the estimated insulin counteraction effect (ICE) is +15 \n, and \n\n\nthe user\u2019s CIR is 10 g/U and the ISF is 50 mg/dL/U,\n\n\n\n\nthen the estimated amount of carbohydrates absorbed at 4pm would be 3g:\n\n\n\n\nThose 3g of carbohydrates would then be split amongst the meals proportional to their minimum absorption rates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresulting in 2g of absorption being attributed to Meal 1 and 1g attributed to Meal 2.\n\n\nMinimum Carbohydrate Absorption Rate\n\u2301\n\n\nIf the estimated carbohydrate absorption of a meal entry is less than what would have been absorbed using the minimum absorption rate, then the minimum absorption rate is used instead. This is to ensure that meal entries expire in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nModeling Remaining Active Carbohydrates\n\u2301\n\n\nAfter the estimated absorbed carbohydrates have been subtracted from each meal entry, the remaining carbohydrates (for each entry) are then forecasted to decay or absorb using the minimum absorption rate. Loop uses this forecast to estimate the effect (active carbohydrates, or carbohydrate activity) of the remaining carbohydrates. The carbohydrate effect can be expressed mathematically using the terms described above:\n\n\n\n\nRetrospective Correction Effect\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nThe retrospective correction effect allows the Loop algorithm to account for effects that are not modeled with the insulin and carbohydrate effects, by comparing historical predictions to the actual blood glucose.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the modeled effects of insulin and carbohydrates, there are many other factors that affect blood glucose (e.g., exercise, stress, hormones, etc.). Many of these effects are active for a period of time. By observing its own forecast error, Loop can estimate the magnitude of these effects and, by assuming that they will continue for some short period of time, incorporate them into the forecast to improve forecast accuracy.\n\n\nTo do this, Loop calculates a retrospective forecast with a start time of 30 minutes in the past, ending at the current time. Loop compares the retrospective forecast to the actual observed change in blood glucose, and the difference is summed into a blood glucose velocity or rate of difference:\n\n\n\n\nwhere BG\nvel\n is a velocity term (mg/dL per 5min) that represents the average blood glucose difference between the retrospective forecast (RF) and the actual blood glucose (BG) over the last 30 minutes. This term is applied to the current forecast from the insulin and carb effects with a linear decay over the next hour. For example, the first forecast point (t=5) is approximately 100% of this velocity, the forecast point one-half hour from now is adjusted by 50% of the velocity, and points from one hour or more in the future are not affected by this term.\n\n\nThe retrospective correction effect can be expressed mathematically:\n\n\n\n\nwhere BG is the predicted change in blood glucose with the units (mg/dL/5min) at time \nt\n over the time range of 5 to 60 minutes, and the other term gives the percentage of BG\nvel\n that is applied to this effect.\n\n\nThe retrospective correction effect can be illustrated with an example: if the BG\nvel\n over the past 30 minutes was -10 mg/dL per 5min, then the retrospective correction effect over the next 60 minutes would be as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinutes relative to now (\nt=0\n)\n\n\nPercent of BG\nvel\n Applied to RC Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n100%\n\n\n-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n91%\n\n\n-9.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n82%\n\n\n-8.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n73%\n\n\n-7.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n64%\n\n\n-6.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n55%\n\n\n-5.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n45%\n\n\n-4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n36%\n\n\n-3.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n27%\n\n\n-2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n18%\n\n\n-1.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\n9%\n\n\n-0.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n0%\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an example below that shows the retrospective correction effect when the BG\nvel\n over the past 30 minutes was -10mg/dL/5min.   \n\n\n\n\nBlood Glucose Momentum Effect\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nThe blood glucose momentum effect incorporates a prediction component based on the assumption that recent blood glucose trends tend to persist for a short period of time. In other words, the best predictor of the future is the recent past.\n\n\n\n\nThe blood glucose momentum portion of the algorithm gives weight or importance to recent blood glucose to improve the near-future forecast. Loop calculates the slope of the last 3 continuous CGM readings (i.e., the last 15 minutes) using linear regression. Using multiple points helps filter out noise in the CGM data while still responding fast to changing situations. That momentum slope (Mslope) is the approximate or average rate of change over the last 15 minutes, though it is normalized to 5 minutes so that the units are (mg/dL/5min). \n\n\nThe momentum slope is then blended into the next 20 minutes of predicted blood glucose from the other effects (i.e., insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction effects). This, in essence, makes the next 20 minutes of blood glucose prediction more sensitive to recent blood glucose trends. The blending of the recent trend slope into the next 20 minutes is weighted so that the first prediction point (5 minutes into the future) is highly influenced by the slope, and the influence of the slope gradually decays over the 20 minute time period. The momentum effect can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: The term \n is also applied to the combined insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction effects to get the delta blood glucose prediction. \n\n\nThe momentum effect can be illustrated with an example: if the last 3 blood glucose readings were 100, 103, and 106 mg/dL, then the slope would be 3 mg/dL per 5 minutes (0.6 mg/dL per minute). The amount of that recent trend or slope applied to the next 20 minutes of predictions (i.e., the next 4 predictions from the other effects) is roughly 100% (3 mg/dL per 5 min) at 5 minutes, 66% (2 mg/dL per 5 min) at 10 minutes, 33% (1 mg/dL per 5 min) at 15 minutes, and 0% (0 mg/dL per 5 min) at 20 minutes.\n\n\nAlso, if the combined effect from the insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction is assumed to be a constant 6 mg/dL/5min over the next 20 minutes, then the expected overall effect and the predicted blood glucose can be calculated as follows. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinutes relative to now (\nt=0\n)\n\n\nPercent of Slope Applied to Momentum Effect\n\n\nMomentum Effect (3mg/dL/5min)\n\n\nPercent of Other Effects Applied Overall Effect\n\n\nOther Effects (Insulin, Carbohydrate, and Retrospective Correction)\n\n\nOverall Effect (mg/dL/5min)\n\n\nPredicted BG (mg/dL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n100%\n\n\n3\n\n\n0\n\n\n6\n\n\n3\n\n\n109\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n66.6%\n\n\n2\n\n\n33.3%\n\n\n6\n\n\n4\n\n\n113\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n33.3%\n\n\n1\n\n\n66.6%\n\n\n6\n\n\n5\n\n\n118\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n0%\n\n\n0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n124\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example is illustrated in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that Loop will not calculate blood glucose momentum in instances where CGM data is not continuous (i.e., must have at least three continuous CGM readings to draw the best-fit straight line trend). It also will not calculate blood glucose momentum when the last three CGM readings contain any calibration points, as those may not be representative of true blood glucose momentum trends. \n\n\nPredicting Glucose\n\u2301\n\n\nAs described in the momentum effect section, the momentum effect is blended with the insulin, carbohydrate, and retrospective correction effects to predict the change in blood glucose:\n\n\n\n\nLastly, the forecast or predicted blood glucose BG at time \nt\n is the current blood glucose BG plus the sum of all blood glucose effects BG over the time interval [t5, t]:\n\n\n\n\nEach individual effect along with the combined effects are illustrated in the figure below. As shown, blood glucose is trending slightly upwards at the time of the prediction. Therefore, the blood glucose momentum effect\u2019s contribution is pulling up the overall prediction from the other three effects for a short time. Retrospective correction is having a dampening effect on the prediction, indicating that the recent rise in blood glucose was not as great as had been previously predicted in the recent past.",

If a user's basal settings were exactly right in traditional pump therapy, the user would have perfectly flat blood glucose all day, all other factors being equal.  In reality, people with type 1 diabetes, and their caregivers, know that basal settings are never exactly right. Every day is a little different, and a myriad of factors that affect blood glucose (e.g., including stress, hormones, sleep, etc.) may affect insulin needs. Some people have different basal profiles to accommodate these variations. Some people regularly tune and adjust their basal rates, and/or do so at their endocrinology clinic visits.  Since the Loop algorithm assumes that the user-set basal rates are correct, it calculates the effect of insulin relative to scheduled basal rates. If basal rates are not entirely correct, Loop can compensate a bit through the retrospective correction and blood glucose momentum effects, discussed later in this page.  The insulin delivery chart below displays a bar-graph history of the temporary basal rates enacted by Loop. The display is relative to the scheduled basal rates entered in the Loop settings. A rate displayed in this chart as +0 would indicate that no temporary basal rate was set and that the basal rate being delivered was the scheduled basal rate. Positive values indicate a temporary basal rate was set above the scheduled basal rate (i.e., more insulin delivered), and negative values indicate that a temporary basal rate was set below the scheduled basal rate (i.e., less insulin delivered).   For example, if the user\u2019s scheduled basal rate is 1 U/hr, and Loop gives a temporary basal rate of 3 U/hr, then it will calculate the expected drop in blood glucose due to +2 U/hr of insulin.  Similarly if Loop sets a temporary basal rate of 0 U/hr for 1 hour, then the insulin effect will also be relative to the current scheduled basal rate of 1 U/hr, and Loop would predict the user\u2019s blood glucose to increase by the amount of change from -1 U/hr of insulin. If the user\u2019s ISF is 50 mg/dL, then Loop would predict blood glucose to rise 50 mg/dL over the insulin activity duration (6 hours).   Here is a real-world example where Loop is setting many temporary basal rates over the course of the day.

Using this initial minimum absorption rate, the remaining carbohydrates are modeled to absorb linearly. For example, if the user enters a 72g carbohydrate meal, and selects an estimated absorption time of 4 hours, then Loop will forecast a 12g/hr absorption rate for the next 6 hours.

Insulin counteraction effects are caused by more than just carbohydrates, and can include exercise, sensitivity changes, or incorrectly configured insulin delivery settings (e.g., basal rate, ISF, etc.). However, since the effect of carbohydrates is often dominant (after insulin), Loop can still make useful ongoing adjustments to its carbohydrate model by assuming that the increase in blood glucose is mainly carbohydrate absorption in the period following recorded meal entries.    The insulin counteraction effect is converted into an estimated carbohydrate absorption amount by using the current carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio and the insulin sensitivity factor at the time of the recorded meal entry.   where AC is the number of carbohydrates absorbed (g/5min), ICE is the insulin counteraction effect, CIR is the carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio (g/U), and ISF is the insulin sensitivity factor (mg/dL/U) at time  t .

Many of these effects are active for a period of time. By observing its own forecast error, Loop can estimate the magnitude of these effects and, by assuming that they will continue for some short period of time, incorporate them into the forecast to improve forecast accuracy.  To do this, Loop calculates a retrospective forecast with a start time of 30 minutes in the past, ending at the current time. Loop compares the retrospective forecast to the actual observed change in blood glucose, and the difference is summed into a blood glucose velocity or rate of difference:   where BG vel  is a velocity term (mg/dL per 5min) that represents the average blood glucose difference between the retrospective forecast (RF) and the actual blood glucose (BG) over the last 30 minutes. This term is applied to the current forecast from the insulin and carb effects with a linear decay over the next hour. For example, the first forecast point (t=5) is approximately 100% of this velocity, the forecast point one-half hour from now is adjusted by 50% of the velocity, and points from one hour or more in the future are not affected by this term.

Minutes relative to now ( t=0 )  Percent of Slope Applied to Momentum Effect  Momentum Effect (3mg/dL/5min)  Percent of Other Effects Applied Overall Effect  Other Effects (Insulin, Carbohydrate, and Retrospective Correction)  Overall Effect (mg/dL/5min)  Predicted BG (mg/dL)      5  100%  3  0  6  3  109     10  66.6%  2  33.3%  6  4  113    15  33.3%  1  66.6%  6  5  118    20  0%  0  100%  6  6  124     This example is illustrated in the figure below.   It is also worth noting that Loop will not calculate blood glucose momentum in instances where CGM data is not continuous (i.e., must have at least three continuous CGM readings to draw the best-fit straight line trend). It also will not calculate blood glucose momentum when the last three CGM readings contain any calibration points, as those may not be representative of true blood glucose momentum trends.",

Therefore, the blood glucose momentum effect\u2019s contribution is pulling up the overall prediction from the other three effects for a short time.

Note that all temporary basal rate commands are issued for 30 minutes, however they may be updated (re-issued) every 5 minutes. Said another way, Loop may enact a new temporary basal rate every 5 minutes. But, if communication with the pump is lost, the last issued temporary basal rate will last for at most 30 minutes before the pump reverts to the user\u2019s scheduled basal rates. Note: If a user is operating Loop in open-loop mode, the Loop will only recommend basal dosing actions and will not automatically enact those recommendations.\n\n\nFour Possible Actions\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop implements one of four possible basal actions: \ndecrease\n, \nincrease\n, \nsuspend\n, or \nresume\n a scheduled basal rate.\n\n\nDecrease Basal Rate\n\u2301\n\n\nIf the eventual blood glucose is less than the correction range and all of the predicted glucose values are above the suspend threshold, then Loop will issue a temporary basal rate that is lower than the current scheduled basal rate to bring the eventual blood glucose up to the correction target.\n\n\n\n\nIncrease Basal Rate\n\u2301\n\n\nIf the eventual blood glucose is greater than the correction range and all of the predicted glucose values are both above the suspend threshold and equal to or above the correction range, then Loop will issue a temporary basal rate that is higher than the current basal rate to bring the eventual blood glucose down to the correction target.\n\n\n\n\nSuspend Basal Rate\n\u2301\n\n\nIf the minimum predicted blood glucose goes below the suspend threshold, then Loop will issue a temporary basal rate of zero units per hour, regardless of the eventual blood glucose.\n\n\n\n\nResume Basal Rate\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are three situations where the Loop algorithm will resume the current scheduled basal rate.\n\n\nIf the eventual blood glucose is within the correction range, and all of the predicted glucose values are above the suspend threshold, then Loop will resume the current scheduled basal rate.\n\n\n\n\nIf the eventual blood glucose is above the correction range, and the predicted glucose values have a temporary excursion below the correction range but still above the suspend threshold, then Loop will resume the current scheduled basal rate.\n\n\n\n\nIf the Loop algorithm does not have ALL of the data it needs to make a prediction, it will let the remaining temporary basal rate run its duration (maximum of 30 minutes), and then the basal rate will default back to the current scheduled basal rate, thus returning to the same therapy pattern that they would receive using a traditional insulin pump.\n\n\nDetermining the Temporary Basal Rate\n\u2301\n\n\nTo determine the corrective temporary basal rate to implement, Loop calculates a \u201cdose\u201d in the same way doses are calculated in both open-loop and traditional insulin pump therapy. It's also the same math many people on multiple-daily injection therapy use. The benefit of Loop (and all other close-loop algorithms) is that it does this math every 5 minutes, and is far less prone to error than humans doing the math. Loop also does its math based on predicting into the future, which traditional pumps and humans, do not always have the time or inclination to do.\n\n\nThe amount of insulin needed, or dose, is calculated using the desired reduction in blood glucose and the user\u2019s ISF. For the Loop algorithm, the desired reduction in blood glucose is the delta between the eventual blood glucose and the correction target:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA major difference between traditional pump therapy and how the Loop calculates dose is that in pump therapy the current blood glucose is used to estimate the dose, whereas in the Loop algorithm the eventual and minimum blood glucose predictions are also used in determining dosing decisions.\n\n\n\n\nLoop then converts the dose into a basal rate using the Loop\u2019s temporary basal rate duration of 30 minutes:\n\n\n\n\nwhere BR is the basal rate (U/hr), which is the amount of insulin needed over the next 30 minutes to bring the eventual blood glucose to the correction target. The basal rate, however, is the amount of basal rate needed beyond the user\u2019s scheduled basal rate. As such, the required basal rate can be determined by:\n\n\n\n\nwhere RBR is the required basal rate and SBR is the scheduled basal rate.\n\n\nFinally, Loop compares the RBR with the user-specified maximum temporary basal rate setting to determine the temporary basal to issue:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf RBR \u2265 maximum basal rate, then Loop will issue the maximum basal rate  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf RBR \n maximum temporary basal rate, then Loop will issue RBR \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter running the temporary basal calculation described above, Loop checks whether there is already an appropriate basal running with at least 10 minutes remaining. If so, Loop will not reissue the temporary basal. However, if the recommended temporary basal differs from the currently running temporary basal \u2014 or the current scheduled basal if no temporary is running \u2014  then Loop will replace the current basal rate with the recommended temporary basal rate. \n\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this section, the process of determining whether a temporary basal should be issued is repeated every 5 minutes.\n\n\nTemporary Basal Rate Calculation Example\n\u2301\n\n\nTo illustrate how the Loop calculates the temporary basal rate to issue, consider the calculation for the following scenario:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEventual blood glucose = 200 mg/dL  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrection target = 100 mg/dL  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nISF = 50 mg/dL/U  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent scheduled basal rate (SBR) is 1 U/hr  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum basal setting (set by user in Loop) = 6 U/hr  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, calculate the dose:\n\n\n\n\nThen, convert the dose into a basal rate to be issued for the next 30 minutes:\n\n\n\n\nNext, calculate the required basal rate:\n\n\n\n\nLastly, compare the required basal rate to the maximum temporary basal rate, and find that Loop will enact a temporary basal rate of 5 U/hr for 30 minutes since this temporary basal rate is below the maximum temporary basal rate of 6 U/hr, which was set by the user in Loop app settings.",

            "text": "Red Loops\n\u2301\n\n\nLet's divide this page up into two parts. The first part deals with individual red loops. Like it just happened and you want to solve it. The second part will deal with situations where you are repeatedly having red loops \"more often\" than you think is \"normal\" (both of those of course are subjective terms).\n\n\nResolving a Red Loop\n\u2301\n\n\nSo you are here for help with getting your Loop green again? It's red and not working? Wondering what is happening? You can click on the red loop icon to read an error message that you may or may not understand. If you understand it, great...that should help you fix the problem. If you don't understand it, then there are two options to fix the red loop; the first is quick and easy, the second is more in-depth. Let's look at both.\n\n\nQuick side note: Do not quickly decide to pull an omnipod that isn't responding and has a red loop. Usually the issue is that the RileyLink needs a reset as described below in Option 1, rather than the pod needing to be changed. If you don't fix the RileyLink's problem first, the problem will likely carry forward to the new pod pairing attempt and you'll get a bunch of problems pairing the new pod because the RileyLink still isn't working. So, please try getting the RileyLink working properly before deciding to ditch a pod because of a red loop.\n\n\nOption 1: Easy Steps\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nYou don't care what the heck is causing the issue, you just want to get on with life as quickly as possible? Ok, fair enough, then do the following:\n\n\n\n\nTurn your RileyLink off/on at its physical power switch located on the side of the RileyLink. Use a small pointy object to carefully move the slider away from the charging port and then back up towards the charging port. A paperclip on the keyring can provide the help you need to reach the switch in the recessed case, and double as a \nscreaming pod silencer tool\n.\n\n\nClose your Loop app (upswiping it in the iPhone's app selector) and reopen it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's pretty much all you need to do for option 1 to restore a green Loop within 5 minutes, 99% of the time. You can confirm things are back to working order by seeing a green loop again and/or issuing a \"test command\" or \"button press\" successfully through the RileyLink menu.\n\n\n\n\nOption 2: Look for Cause\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nSo if Option 1 didn't work to fix your problem...next you'll need to look a little deeper. There can be a variety of causes for why Option 1 did not work to restore your Loop's function, so you'll need to sort out the root cause. There are a few basic categories:\n\n\n\n\nRileyLink is broken\n\n\nCGM values are not being collected by Loop\n\n\nPump is not responding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRileyLink is broken\n\u2301\n\n\nHow can you tell if your RileyLink has a problem? The answer is mostly within the LED lights that display on the board.\n\n\nRed light\n: comes on during charging and will turn off/on periodically, while still plugged in, after charge is complete.\n\n\nGreen light\n: Indicates an active BT connection with the phone. You want the green light to stay on all the time on the RileyLink. If the green light is not on, then make sure your iPhone's bluetooth is still switched on.\n\n\nBlue light\n: The blue light will flash off/on periodically when the RileyLink and pump are actively communicating...it should NOT be always on. If your blue light is stuck on, that is an indication of a problem on the board. Try looking for signs of damage or debris that may be causing a short on the board. Clean the board with rubbing alcohol \n(unplug the battery first\n). If you still can't get the blue light off, then contact GetRileyLink about getting a new RileyLink.\n\n\nCGM Values are not being collected by Loop\n\u2301\n\n\nNew transmitter\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you recently changed a transmitter, you need to also update your Loop settings to reflect the new transmitter ID. Go to the CGM section of Loop settings and \nDelete CGM\n (it's a button on the bottom of that page). Then use the \nAdd CGM\n in Loop settings to include the new transmitter ID.\n\n\nFirefly-style transmitter\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you have not updated your Loop app since late July 2019 and use Dexcom G6, you will need to update your Loop app to continue to be able to loop without internet connection. In July 2019, we started to see a new style of Dexcom G6 transmittters on the market. These new transmitters required a rework of some of the Loop's code to continue to \"spy\" on the transmitter. Without the update, your Loop will not get CGM data unless it is pulling from Share servers (which is not a recommended mode of operation). So, update your Loop app if you have a new transmitter type and haven't updated since July 2019.\n\n\nDelete Share account\n\u2301\n\n\nFinally, we see a lot of errors reported because people have problems with their Share server information in Loop app. \nPlease delete your Share account information from within Loop settings.\n In other words, the credentials portion of the Share account info, as shown in the screenshot below, should say \nTap to Set\n and not have your account info. It is unnecessary to have this portion filled out as local, non-internet spying of a transmitter is the preferred CGM source anyways. In fact, by leaving this information out, it will help you remember to change your transmitter ID when you change transmitters because CGM data won't appear in Loop. By not including Share account in Loop, you will prevent yourself from accidentally becoming internet dependent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPump is not responding\n\u2301\n\n\nThe obvious fix is to make sure the RileyLink is not so far away from the pump or Pod that they cannot communicate. Assuming you've addressed this, then you can move on to other steps. For Pod Loopers, Option 1 almost always fixes this issue. For Medtronic Loopers, you will see some times where the pump is not responding and you may see \"decoding\" errors or various other messages about pump responses. For Medtronic users, try the following:\n\n\n\n\nChange pump battery. Low pump battery will cause radio communications to fail.\n\n\nUse the \nChange Time\n command in the RileyLink menu to update the pump's clock. If you've accidentally changed the pump's time in the pump itself, this will get the Loop app and pump back in sync.\n\n\nIf using a x23 or x54 pump, try deleting all the IDs under the \"Other Devices\" submenu in the pump's \"Connect Devices\" menu.  Then go to the RileyLink menu and use the MySentry pairing command to get a fresh ID issued. Follow the directions listed in the MySentry pairing command's screen to scan for devices. A fresh ID can help prevent recurring red loops for x23 and x54 users, particularly if they started to occur after a recent Loop update.\n\n\nMake sure the following are checked in the pump:\n\n\nYour pump cannot be suspended.  Resume insulin deliveries.\n\n\nTemp basal type must be set to unit/hour, not percent, in pump's Basal menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResolving Frequent Red Loops\n\u2301\n\n\nHere's some things to check if you have frequent red loops:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you \ncleaned your mLab database in Nightscout\n recently? If your database gets backlogged (or Nightscout otherwise isn't working properly), Loop can get clogged up with a bunch of unfinished Nightscout uploads. This clogged condition can cause red loops. So, make sure you are periodically checking your mLab and cleaning it. Try deleting your Nightscout account from Loop settings and see if your Loop stops having red loops. If it does, then you'll need to assess what's going wrong in your Nightscout site and fix it. Most of the time that is your mLab database cleanup needing to be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs your \nRileyLink battery plugged in all the way\n on the board? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHas your RL been fully charged? Try charging your RL for an hour or two, make sure the red light comes on while charging. Try a new charger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOddly, some people have found that turning off Siri integrations for Loop and Dexcom apps in your iPhone settings has helped. I don't know if this is coincidental or an actual help yet, but I'll mention it here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck for sources of wireless interference. If you have a certain environment that seems to have more drops than others, it is likely that there is a source of wireless communication interfering with your Loop. Lots of Medtronic Loopers in a room together will often interfere with each other and get \"cross-talk\" red loop error messages. If it is a bedroom at night causing problems, try moving other wireless devices such as routers or baby monitors farther away from where you and your RileyLink are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosting for Help\n\u2301\n\n\nBefore you post on Looped group for help with a red loop, please make sure you've tried Option 1 and have restarted your RileyLink and Loop app. \n\n\nBefore you post for help, please also check your mLab and Nightscout status. This step is often overlooked and yet solves a lot of problems. \n\n\nWhen posting for help, include two screenshots of Loop's main screen; one with the red loop's error message and the other just the plain Loop main screen. Include a detailed description of what you have tried doing from the troubleshooting list above. For example, state if you've double checked the transmitter ID, deleted the Share account info from Loop settings, and updated your Loop app since July 19, 2019 so that we can rule out some of the causes of CGM issues.",

            "text": "Pod Pairing Failures\n\u2301\n\n\nHave you seen an error message during the pairing process for a new pod? The most common messages are \"No response from pod\" or \"Pod sent ack instead of response\", as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring pairing a number of possible errors can leave the pod in an apparent non-responding state. This page will help you walk through some easy troubleshooting steps to hopefully recover that pod into good working order.\n\n\nWhy do pod pairings fail?\n\u2301\n\n\nAssuming the RileyLink is ok, the most common cause of a pod pairing failure is that Loop incorrectly partially pairs with the pod due to some problems during the fragile pairing process, perhaps aggravated the placement of the RileyLink and the pod, wireless communications interference, and/or incorrect handling of some fault and retry conditions. There have been (and likely will be more) code improvements to reduce various pairing problems and automatically recover from them if they do happen. \nMake sure you stay on top of Loop updates to take advantage of these code improvements.\n\n\n\n\nMove Logically\n\n\nLet's walk through the pod pairing/replacement process from the very beginning to make sure that we have all the important steps clearly identified even before you attempt to press that \nPair\n button.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Verify the RileyLink\n\u2301\n\n\nFirst, let's make sure everything is ok as far as the RileyLink goes:\n\n\n\n\nRileyLink is charged and nearby, and\n\n\nRileyLink has a green LED light lit (indicating a Bluetooth connection with your iPhone), and\n\n\nTry toggling the RileyLink off/on at its physical switch if the green light is not on.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Deactivate old Pod\n\u2301\n\n\nMake sure you've deactivated your old pod. If you had issues deactivating your pod, you likely may have some RileyLink issues going on...so make sure to see the steps above. If you have a problem with deactivating a pod, go ahead and skip to Step 5 to get a new pod going. You should also remove that old pod (that would not deactivate) from your vicinity. Put it in a microwave or throw it over the fence into the neighbor's backyard (kidding, obviously...but outside trashcan is a good idea).\n\n\nStep 3: Start new pairing process\n\u2301\n\n\nYou've deactivated your old pod successfully...great! As the first part of pairing a new pod, Loop will prompt you to fill the new pod with insulin. Once a new pod is powered-up by the insertion of at least 85 units of insulin, the pod will emit reminder beeps every 5 or 10 minutes until the entire pod pairing process has completed. This pairing process must be completed within 60 minutes of beeps starting, or the pod will give up and never pair. These activation reminder beeps do not actually indicate that any pod communication is being attempted, just that the activation has not yet been completed and your 60 minute timer is counting down.\n\n\nHopefully, your pod pairing continues uneventfully at this point. You'll press the \nPair\n button and the pod pairs, primes, and the cannula insertion is successful. BUT, if not...you'll want to keep reading Steps 4-5 to find out how to recover.\n\n\n\n\nOne beeping pod at a time, please\n\n\nIt is very important to not have two pods giving reminder beeps at the same time\n as this can cause even more confusion for you and for Loop. Continue to work with a single pod at a time, retrying the \nPair\n attempts multiple times if needed as described in Step 4. \n\n\nIf you cannot get the pairing to complete with the single beeping pod (after trying the procedures described below a few times with multiple \nPair\n attempts during each try), then you should completely abandon that pod before attempting to use another pod. \"Completely abandon\" means move that failed-to-pair-no-matter-what-you-tried pod far, far away from you or put it in a not-turned-on-but-door-is-closed microwave. You do not want that beeping-but-not-pairing pod to be able to plague your next pod's communications with Loop during the fresh pairing process.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Check the RileyLink and Pod's Placement\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nPod pairing failed?\n\n\nOk, so you've pressed that \nPair\n button and received an error message like shown at the top of screen? It's time to start the stepwise process of seeing if we can get it to recover successfully.\n\n\n\n\nThe placement of the pod and the RileyLink relative to each other is critical variable because the pod operates in a low power radio mode during pairing which can lead to a number of potential faulty and half-paired pod situations, particularly with earlier versions of Loop. \n\n\nHow close should they be?\n Most people assume \"the closer the better\", but it has been measured that if the RileyLink and pod are \ntoo close together\n, the RileyLink may not be able to pick up the pairing response. The current recommendation is for the RileyLink to be placed a few inches to the side of the pod being paired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPair\n fails, move a bit and RETRY\n\n\n\n\nIf the \nPair\n operation is not succeeding, try repositioning the relative placement of the RileyLink and the pod multiple times. A little closer together if you had them far apart? A bit farther apart if they were really close? RileyLink on its side? Try standing it up with the antenna pointed to the ceiling.\n\n\nIf the pairing is still unsuccessful with multiple repositioning attempts, move yourself, the RileyLink, and the pod to another area/room (preferably away from other radio frequency signals that might be interfering), and try \nPair\n again. Again don't be shy to try repositioning the RileyLink and pod's relative position, if needed, in this new area/room too.\n\n\nIf you have another available RileyLink, you can also try pairing using that RileyLink instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Pod Pairing Recovery\n\u2301\n\n\nWhen you have a pod that continues to appear non-responsive or sending \"ack\" responses after several retried \nPair\n attempts, it may be possible to recover by forcing Loop to start the pairing process from the beginning. \n\n\nTo start we will have to press the \nCancel\n button in the upper right corner of the pairing screen. Depending on which state the pod is stuck at in the pairing process...you'll see one of two screens after you select the \nCancel\n button. Follow the directions (Step 5A vs Step 5B) for whichever screen corresponds to what you see after pressing \nCancel\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5A \"Switch from Omnipod Pumps\": You press \nCancel\n and Loop will send you back to the \nPod Settings\n screen to do the \"Switch from Omnipod Pumps\" method\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5B \"Deactivate\": You press \nCancel\n and Loop will display a screen giving the option to \"Deactivate\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5A \"Switch from Omnipod Pumps\"\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you press the \nCancel\n button and see a screen like below, you're going to select \nSwitch from Omnipod Pumps\n in red. While this appears to confirm that you want to stop using the Omnipod, we will be adding pods back soon. Don't worry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't fret. None of your Loop settings including the basal schedule and delivery limits, will be lost deleting the Omnipod pump. Select \nDelete Omnipod\n to proceed which will take you back to the Loop home screen.  From here, select the gear icon at the bottom right to go the Loop \nSettings\n page. Then select \nAdd Pump\n in blue and then select \nOmnipod\n from the \nAdd Pump\n list displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that the green LED on the RileyLink goes on and off as you touch the switch for RileyLink you are using indicating a successful Bluetooth connection between the RileyLink and your iPhone. Leave the RileyLink enabled with its green LED and slider turned on, and then touch the \nContinue\n button on the bottom. The Pod Settings screen should have the previous Basal Rates and Delivery Limits in effect from your previous run which can be verified at this time. Once ready, select \nContinue\n on the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you will be back to the \nPod Pairing\n screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of filling a new pod with insulin, attempt to pair again using the original pod which was previously filled but unable to complete the pairing process successfully. That pod should still be occassionally giving reminder beeps. Place the RileyLink a few inches to the side of the pod and press the \nPair\n button at the bottom of the screen and hopefully Loop will be able to successfully pair this time after starting from a fresh slate. If this pairing attempt is still unsuccessful, remember to still exhaust repositioning and Step 4 options before giving up on that pod. If it really won't pair after all that...then mark that loser pod with a Sharpie-drawn sad face and follow the directions in Step 3's colored box so that you don't end up with multiple beeping pods around accidentally.\n\n\nStep 5B \"Deactivate pod\"\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you press the \nCancel\n button and see an option for \"Deactivate pod\", we're going to do a little different than Step 5A.\n\n\n\n\nYou \nmight\n lose your pod by attempting this procedure\n\n\nThis is a point of no return for certain pod pairing situations and it is possible that the pod will be lost by attempting this procedure depending on the pod state. Some will recover fine, others may not. Since you can't know in advance if you might lose the pod, it is important to have already exhausted other possibilities described above in Steps 1-4 to try pairing. Specifically, (1) attempting to pair several times using varied relative positions of the RileyLink and pod (2) trying the pairing again but in a different room/location that might have less wireless interference, and (3) verifying your RileyLink is connected and functioning correctly.\n\n\n\n\nFor this next part, we want to make sure that the pod doesn't accidentally receive the deactivation command we are about to use. We want Loop to do the command...we just really don't want the pod to hear it. There's two ways we can keep the pod from hearing it, either (1) prevent the RileyLink from hearing Loop's command (and thus the command cannot reach the pod) or (2) prevent the pod from hearing the command from RileyLink. To accomplish our keep-the-pod-ignorant goal, you can try either option like so:\n\n\n\n\nPrevent RileyLink from hearing: Turn your RileyLink off temporarily at its physical switch. Some people worry about accidentally breaking their RileyLink switch, and if that's you...you can instead put the RileyLink far away from your iPhone or put the RileyLink in the microwave. That will keep the RileyLink from hearing the Loop's deactivate pod command. If RileyLink can't hear it, then your pod won't receive it.\n\n\nPrevent pod from hearing: Move the beeping pod to a place that the pod is incapable of hearing the command. There's several options depending on what works for you:\n\n\nPut the beeping pod far away...\"shouldn't be able to hear those beeps anymore\" kind of distance. \n\n\nPut the pod in a not-turned-on-but-door-is-closed microwave. \n\n\nPut the pod in a faraday bag, if you own one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk. Have the pod nice and ignorant? Good. Now press the \"Deactivate Pod\" button. It will take a few attempts, and you will see some failure messages about how the deactivation failed (of course it did...we hid the pod!) Eventually, you'll be given an \"Continue\" button that you'll want to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress the \"Continue\" button. The instructions start with \"fill a new pod with insulin\"...BUT DO NOT!  Instead, bring that beeping pod back to the hearing range. Turn that RileyLink back on if you turned it off. Once you get the RileyLink on and the pod back in range, you'll just press the \nPair\n button and hopefully you'll find success with the process. If this pairing attempt is still unsuccessful, remember to still exhaust repositioning and Step 4 options before giving up on that pod. If it really won't pair after all that...then mark that loser pod with a Sharpie-drawn sad face and follow the directions in Step 3's colored box so that you don't end up with multiple beeping pods around accidentally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Help improve pod pairing process\n\u2301\n\n\nTo help fix pairing bugs, some improvements have also been made in our ability to save the communications between the pods and Loop app during the pairing process. So, please help us leverage these new improvements and better squash bugs.\n\n\nIf you run into any pairing problems which required Step 5A or Step 5B to be able to pair, or you had a pod that had to be abandoned, it would be helpful to generate an \"Issue Report\" after you finally get a pod paired (whether is was the original pod or if a different pod) and then post the resulting \"Loop Report\" on \nZulipchat here\n with a short explanation of what happened.\n\n\nWhat about other pod start-up failures?\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you have a pod that has already started the priming operation and then has problems either finishing the priming operation or the cannula insertion, then forcing a pod pairing recovery is not possible. If a pod fails during priming or cannula insertion, the pod is no good and it should be deactivated and disposed of properly.\n\n\nWhat about that insulin?\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you have the misfortune of losing a pod during pairing, you can opt to not waste the insulin in that pod. Simply use the same syringe and same fill port on the pod to suck the insulin OUT of the loser pod. \n\n\nIf you do that, good practice is to make sure that you get that loser pod far away from the process as you go forward. Mark a big \"X\" on the failed pod and put it in a microwave, or very far away from you, so that it can't interfere with subsequent pod pairing attempts.",

This pairing process must be completed within 60 minutes of beeps starting, or the pod will give up and never pair. These activation reminder beeps do not actually indicate that any pod communication is being attempted, just that the activation has not yet been completed and your 60 minute timer is counting down.  Hopefully, your pod pairing continues uneventfully at this point. You'll press the  Pair  button and the pod pairs, primes, and the cannula insertion is successful.

However, that said, some of the most common pump errors are repairable, or not actually a real problem.\n\n\nA21 error\n\u2301\n\n\nThis error message is common when a pump has been stored for a period of time without a battery.  Most pumps will show an A21 error when you first purchase them on the used market.  Not a big deal.  Press the down arrow (also has the symbol of a light bulb on it) and the pump screen message will scroll down to let you know how to clear that error message (press ESC then ACT).  If the message is coming up on a pump that hasn't been in storage, pull the battery out and replace with a fresh, new battery.  Chances are your battery or battery cap are old.  Look for signs of dirt or rust in the battery cap, give it a little cleaning.\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Tip\n\n\nWhen the pump screen has a little black/white bar on the right side, that is a scroll bar.  Use the arrow keys on the right of the pump screen to scroll and see the additional information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatt Out Limit\n\u2301\n\n\nThis error message \"battery out of limits\" has to do with the internal pump battery, not the AAA battery you replace.  The internal battery cannot be replaced, and unfortunately also has a finite lifespan.  The error message is more of an annoyance than a true problem.  You can try to change the AAA battery faster.  But, the worst-case scenario is that you'll have to re-enter the time and date when you get this message more often.  (Don't forget to use RileyLink to set the time after you get this message.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButton Error\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Button Error message usually happens from water, moisture, or dust getting under the pump's button pad and causing button(s) to fail.  The fix luckily is quite straight-forward and takes less than 30 minutes.  Check out the fix \nhere for a YouTube video\n or \nhere for photo gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution involves simply prying up the button pad's sticker face to expose the layers beneath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see some evidence of crud/rust on the underside of this button pad which caused the button error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you finish your fix, another excellent idea is to make sure you add a length of clear packing tape across the front face of the pump to prevent errant water or dirt from having easy access to the button pad seams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrack/Missing Piece Repairs\n\u2301\n\n\nAnother common issue on these Medtronic pumps are cracks and/or missing bits of plastic near the battery cap or reservoir sleeve. You can repair these fairly easily. For filling small cracks, \nTestor's plastic cement\n or \nGorilla epoxy\n are good choices.\n\n\nFor more extensive repairs to replace missing chunks of plastic, \nGorilla epoxy\n or \nSugru\n are excellent choices.  \n\n\nYou can use \nteflon thread tape\n on the battery cap to make sure the epoxy or Sugru don't stick to the battery cap, but still recreate the threads.  The first photos are of a Sugru repair and second set of photos are Gorilla epoxy repair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotor error\n\u2301\n\n\nOften a motor error is the result of a poorly seated reservoir or tubing cap.  If you get a motor error, the first thing you should do is detach from your infusion site.  Remove and reseat the reservoir, prime again, and see if the motor error resolves.  If it does not, try replacing the tubing cap on the reservoir (new tubing).  If that does not resolve the motor error, also replace the entire reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA33 error\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nSafety warning\n\n\nIf you get this error, DO NOT push on the bulged out end cap.  Always detach your tubing from your infusion set before addressing this error message.  If you push on the end cap in an attempt to get it back flush, you may delivery a dangerous amount of insulin mistakenly.\n\n\n\n\nThis error is a bit more involved to repair.  The problem is that there is a loose drive support cap.  Most of the time this error message will appear during a priming event as the end cap of the drive will slip, releasing the ability of the reservoir plunger to get pressure to delivery insulin.  The pump senses the lack of pressure and delivers the A33 error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution is to UNHOOK from your site.  See warning above.  Remove reservoir and put your finger inside the reservoir sleeve.  Push on the drive so that the end cap is pushed out the most possible.  This will give your the most surface area possible to place the super glue GEL that you will use.  (don't use regular super glue...it must be gel.)  Remove the sticker that covers the end cap, save it for later because you can reattach when repair is completed.\n\n\nWith the end cap pushed out, take some glue gel with the toothpick and apply it on the outside of the popped out cap . Be generous cause you can do this only once . Once you are done take a napkin and press hard the cap toward the pump so it can go back inside and keep it pressed for a few seconds. Then remove all the small parts of the napkin that has glued to the pump. Leave the pump to dry for about 10-15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow to test whether the pumps was glued well. You have already waited about 10-15 minutes so put your finger back in and press hard the plunger.  If you glued it well, the end cap will not move.  If the cap goes out again, you have to glue one more time. If all looks well, put some glue back on top of the pump cap and reattach the sticker that was removed to start.\n\n\nA32 and E22 error loop\n\u2301\n\n\nFrom what we know, this set of error codes seems like a pump killer.  A call to Medtronic support gave this less than hopeful information:\n\n\nA32 - failure of flash memory\nE22 - software re-installation is necessary\n\n\nWe don't have any reports of a good fix for these error codes.

            "text": "Overview\n\u2301\n\n\nNightscout (NS) is an excellent tool for remotely viewing Loop's actions.  It allows for easy remote monitoring of Loop activities, troubleshooting of Loop errors, history of CGM, carbs, boluses, \n temp basals, reports analyzing data trends and patterns. There is a Nightscout app in your iPhone App Store, or you can use a web browser to view the data.  Setting up Nightscout is free and fairly quick.  Once set up, the site can be accessed by anyone that you share your unique Nightscout URL with.  \n\n\nNightscout is highly recommended for Loop users, especially those using Loop as caregivers to t1ds.  Nightscout displays are often the easiest way to troubleshoot Loop settings, if you are having problems and seeking input from others.  Below is some discussion about the general Nightscout display, as well as some Loop-specific display information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood Glucose\n\u2301\n\n\nYour blood glucose (BG) readings from your CGM are shown in green, yellow, or red in the main graph area of NS.  You can adjust your high and low BG targets in NS (when NS alerts will start for high/low BGs), but those will not affect your Loop performance.  Loop only uses the BG targets given in the Loop app settings.  The main screen of BGs is displaying the time duration you have selected (in the example above, 12 hours of BG history).  The bottom of the screen shows the last 48-hours of BG trends.  You can scan backward by dragging the bottom timeline to the left, if you want to review specific Loop actions or data in the last two days. \n\n\n\n\nSAGE, CAGE, BAGE pills\n\u2301\n\n\nThe SAGE, CAGE, and BAGE pills are for Sensor Age, Cannula Age, and (pump) Battery Age.  These optional pills track the time since your CGM sensor, Pump site, and Pump battery were last changed.  You can set up custom alerts to remind you when it is time to change the devices, or simply use the visuals to keep track of your particular timing for site/sensor changes. These fields will not auto-update from pump or CGM devices, instead you will have to update them using Nightscout Careportal so that the pill information is accurate.\n\n\n\n\nCarbs\n\u2301\n\n\nCarbs are automatically uploaded to NS by the Loop app.  The amount of carbs on board (active carbs or COB) can be seen by clicking the Loop pill.  The size of a white carb dot on the graph is proportional to the amount of carbs entered...bigger meals get bigger dots. Loop does not read carbs from NS for use in looping calculations, it only uploads carbs to NS that have been entered in the Loop app.\n\n\n\n\nBoluses\n\u2301\n\n\nInsulin boluses are also automatically uploaded to NS by the Loop app.  The bolus is shown as a filled-in blue lower-half of the dot, and the specific amount of the bolus is also shown.  There may be a slight delay between when the carbs for a meal are uploaded to NS to when the meal bolus appears.  This is because depending on the pump model and size of bolus, the bolus may take a few minutes to actually be administered then Loop has to perform a pump read to verify the reservoir volume has decreased (i.e., the bolus was given).  As shown in the example above, the meal carbs have been uploaded, but the bolus delivery is still in progress.  Insulin on board (active insulin or IOB) is also shown in the Loop pill.\n\n\n\n\nTemp Basals\n\u2301\n\n\nWithin your NS profile, you will enter in the scheduled basal for your Loop user.  This is not automatically updated when you update the Loop app or your pump; you will have to manually update your basal profile in your NS site if you change your basal profile in Loop and/or pump. (Note: The dev branch does now update NS with the basal schedule from Loop, but dev is considered generally less stable than the master branch).   If you don't update the NS basal profile, it doesn't cause any problems in Loop function...you simply won't have accurate VISUAL representation of high/low temp basals within NS. The dashed blue line represents the scheduled basal profile (as entered in your NS profile).  The solid blue lines indicate the actual basal amounts set for a given time...so as Loop sets temp basals higher or lower than your scheduled basal rate, the solid blue line will jump above or below your dashed blue line.  There is a slight delay (up to 2-5 minutes) in the rendering of basal changes on the blue lines, so if you want the accurate current basal rate, you can check the Loop pill.\n\n\n\n\nPredicted BG\n\u2301\n\n\nThe purple line to the right of the BG is Loop's predicted BG.  Watching the behavior of that purple line can help you understand why Loop is making decisions regarding high or low temps.  You can read more on that topic in the Algorithm section of these docs.\n\n\n\n\nLoop pill\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Loop pill is the little display box which when hovered over, or clicked, will provide additional information about recent Loop activities and status.  Information included is the last time Loop ran, the temp basal set, IOB, and COB.  Looking at the Loop pill is a quick method for assessing if you loop is currently active, as well.\n\n\n\n\nLoop Pill status indicator symbols\n\n\nX\n \n\nError in Loop\n\n\n\u03d5\n \n\nRecommending basal, but not enacting (open loop or pump suspended)\n\n\n\u2301\n \n\nEnacted a new temp basal\n\n\n\u21bb\n \n\nLoop is continuing with last temp basal, no change\n\n\n\u26a0\n \n\nWarning indicating Loop is either red or has failed to upload to Nightscout for a longer period of time.\n\n\n\n\nMouseover or Touch the Loop pill to view a tool tip containing one or more of the latest status messages.

You choose which works best for you. Isn't it nice to have options?\n\n\nT1Pal (paid service)\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Nightscout Dexcom Devices\n\n\nT1Pal does NOT support European Dexcom Devices at this time.\n\n\n\n\nT1Pal is only dedicated NS hosting\n company.  There is a hosting fee required which is used to help ensure Nightscout runs without limits and receives improvements.  Setup is simple and loop plugins are configured automatically during the setup guide.\n\n\n\n\nSelect \nGet Started\n to register an account at \nT1Pal\n.  You will need to enter your credit card, which helps ensure Nightscout is running correctly.\n\n\nSelect \"visualize treatments\" in the setup menu and select \"loop.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional DIY (free, do-it-yourself)\n\u2301\n\n\nTwo options exist for easy DIY hosting of NS; Azure or Heroku. Both hosting services are free.  However,  Azure has data quotas monthly and shorter-term CPU quotas.  If you exceed those quotas, you may be facing a monthly data-use bill or being locked out of NS for about 12 hours until the quotas reset.  As you start to use NS more intensively for alarms, pebble watches, etc\u2026it is possible that you may exceed your monthly data cap on Azure.  Many Loop users have transitioned their old sites from Azure over to Heroku and have found the hosting change to be beneficial.  Heroku also has some memory limits, but those limits have been more than adequate for Loop users.  Therefore, we recommend new users start with Heroku.\n\n\nIf you are the person who enjoys videos...here's a YouTube video that you can use to walk-through with these directions. Just give it a click.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't enjoy videos, then here is a step-by-step guide for completing your own Nightscout site DIY style.\n\n\nStep 1: Heroku Account\n\u2301\n\n\nCreate an account at \nHeroku's signup page\n. \n\n\nEnter your name, email address, role (\"Hobbyist\" is fine) and choose \"Node.js\" as the Primary Development Language.  When you get all those entered, confirm that you are not a robot and click the blue \"Create Free Account\" button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow follow the directions and check your email to confirm your Heroku account. You'll be asked to create a password...save that password somewhere. You'll likely be logging into Heroku as part of Looping in the future, so this is a good password to save.\n\n\nWhen you finish creating the password, you'll see a screen like below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have to complete one last step...adding a credit card to your Heroku account. Don't worry, Heroku is still free...but it's only free if you leave a credit card on file. I've used Heroku for 6 years now and never been charged.\n\n\nTo add your credit card, click on the icon of a little ninja person in the upper right corner of the Heroku site, and then select Account Settings and then Billing...or \nthis should take you right to the billing page for your account\n. Then click the purple \"Add credit card\" button. Finish the steps to add a credit card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you finish that, you can just leave that page/tab alone and move on down to the next step below. \n\n\nStep 2: Create an account at GitHub\n\u2301\n\n\nGo to \nGitHub's signup page\n. Fill out the information to create your own unique username (write it down), email address, and password (also write this one down). Verify that you are a real person by tossing an animal's image around until it is upright...and then you'll be able to click the green \"create an account\" at the bottom of the page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGithub will then ask if you want the Free Account (duh, yes). Confirm that (and unclick the Newsletter subscription if you don't want spam).\n\n\nFinally, Github will ask you a little about your programming experience and what you are going to use GitHub for...you can answer those or choose the \"skip this step\" option at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\nFinally, you'll be sent the email to verify your new account. Go to your emails and click the link sent to you.\n\n\nStep 3: Fork and deploy cgm-remote-monitor\n\u2301\n\n\nNow go to the \nNightscout cgm-remote-monitor repository\n. This is where the Nightscout developer's store their code that we are going to borrow a copy of. A copy of code in Github is called a \"fork\". In the upper right corner, you'll find a little button labeled \nFork\n.  Click that button and you'll see a message that GitHub is cloning/forking a copy of that code to your GitHub account.  That is a good thing.  Don't worry it only takes a few seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the forking is done, scroll down (below all those folder and file names) until you see the purple \nDeploy to Heroku\n button. Click that button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty quickly, you should see a Heroku screen popup for \"Create New App\".  If you see that, you're good to go onto the next step to start setting up the Heroku Nightscout app.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Setup your Heroku Nightscout app\n\u2301\n\n\nHeroku calls the code that you just deployed an \"app\"...but probably easier for most people to imagine it as a website. \n\n\nThe first step is to give your \"app\" a name, this will be the prefix of your soon-to-be-created Nightscout site\u2019s URL. For example, if you enter \"janehasthesugars\" then your Nightscout site's URL will be \nhttps://janehasthesugars.herokuapp.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow scroll down a bit and we are going to fill out the information lines in the \nConfig Vars\n section (circled in red above) of that page. There are many variables listed in that section, but we will only \nneed\n to edit a few of them right now to get started. You can always go back later and edit the default values of your BG alarms and other defaults (or do it now, if you'd like). The variables listed below though do need you to make some edits/entries or review that the default settings work for your situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARIABLE\n\n\nVALUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI_SECRET\n\n\nCreate your own API_SECRET\u2026this is like the password to your NS site.  Please write it down somewhere safe or commit it to memory, you will be using it in the future.  It needs to be at least 12 characters long and should NOT use the @ or ! symbols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDISPLAY_UNITS\n\n\ndefault is mg/dl, you'll need to change to mmol if that's what you use\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENABLE\n\n\nbridge loop pump iob cob basal careportal sage cage bage openaps override\n(Enter all of the words above without commas.  Just add a single space between each word. Make sure autocorrect does not add space between careportal. Typically, the words basal and careportal will already be there waiting for you.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRIDGE_USER_NAME\n\n\nEnter your Dexcom Share Account login name. This is not an email address. This should be the same account name used in the Looper's Dexcom app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRIDGE_PASSWORD\n\n\nEnter your Dexcom Share Account password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRIDGE_SERVER\n\n\nThe default assumes the Dexcom user is using a US Dexcom account. \nIf you are outside the US, you need to change this entry to EU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOST COMMON ERRORS\n\n\nThe \nBRIDGE_PASSWORD\n and \nBRIDGE_USER_NAME\n are NOT visible from within your Dexcom app or online account. The values for them are what you entered into your Dexcom mobile app when you VERY FIRST logged into that app however long ago. The \nBRIDGE_USER_NAME\n is not an email address. The most common error on initial Nightscout setups is that people incorrectly use an old account or an old password. To test your username and password, go to \nDexcom's Clarity\n page and try logging into your Dexcom account. If your account info doesn't let you in, or you don't see data in your Clarity account...then you need to figure out your actual credentials before moving ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Dexcom Share outside the United States, you will need to make sure you have EU in the BRIDGE_SERVER.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEY\n\n\nVALUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRIDGE_SERVER\n\n\nEU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have all the variables fixed up, click the purple \nDeploy\n button at the bottom of screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWait about 5 minutes while Heroku builds your Nightscout app. You\u2019ll see some text scroll by in the Build App box, and then finally, you will have a message that the app was successfully deployed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nClick on the \nManage App\n button and then we will move onto the next step.\n\n\nStep 5: Additional Variables\n\u2301\n\n\nSelect the \nSettings\n tab near the top of the screen on your Heroku app. Click on \nReveal Config  Vars\n button that will be partway down the page. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down to the bottom of the variables list until you find the last blank one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are going to add several additional lines of variables specifically for Loop use; the \nDEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED\n is a required line, the others just make Nightscout more useful when Looping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEY\n\n\nVALUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED\n\n\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUMP_FIELDS\n\n\nbattery reservoir clock status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUMP_RETRO_FIELDS\n\n\nbattery reservoir clock status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHOW_FORECAST\n\n\nloop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHOW_PLUGINS\n\n\nloop pump cob iob sage cage careportal basal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOOP_ENABLE_ALERTS\n\n\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOOP_WARN\n\n\n20\n(This is the minutes since Loop last successfully looped, the t1d will have a similar notification at this time through the Loop app.  This will be a yellow alert in NS.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOOP_URGENT\n\n\n60\n(Same as the alert above, but will be red in color and have a shorter snooze option.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBASAL_RENDER\n\n\ndefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I recommend deleting the \nPAPERTRAIL_API_TOKEN\n line. Heroku offers a free, tiny amount of Papertrail service (like a logging service for how the site is running), but really offers only confusion to most people later when they get a message that their \"Free Papertrail Service has run out of room\". Papertrail is not needed, and really doesn't provide useful info for Nightscout users anyways...so best to just delete that line and never have to get the useless email in the first place.\n\n\nStep 6: Setup Profile\n\u2301\n\n\nNow that we have finished all the variable setup, scroll up to the top of the page and click on the \nOpen App\n button in the top right corner of your Heroku site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see black site with a profile warning at the top of the screen. Confirm to redirect to a profile set-up page.  (If it doesn't redirect automatically, refresh your webpage...might have to push the button a few times).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou do not have to enter all the information in the profile if you are using Loop (since Loop will be providing the information for IOB and COB rather than letting NS calculate them), but you do have to fill out the \nTimeZone\n. That one is non-negotiable. I highly recommend also filling in the \nInsulin to carb ratio\n, \nInsulin Sensitivity Factor\n, and \nBasal Rates\n so that your information is properly displayed in Nightscout. To be clear, those values you enter in the Profile will not affect your Loop in any way, because Loop will not read them from Nightscout. New versions of Loop will also update these values in this Profile if you change the corresponding settings in Loop. So really, this is just a one-time setup and after that Loop will do the work of updating these values. \n\n\nClick \nSave\n when you have entered the information.  You will be prompted to authenticate, if it is the first time you\u2019ve used the device to make changes in your profile.  Click on the \nAuthenticate\n link at the bottom of the site, and enter your API_SECRET to complete the authentication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose out of the Profile Editor to return to the main Nightscout page and configure your NS settings.\n\n\nStep 7: Nightscout Settings\n\u2301\n\n\nThe last step is to finish your Nightscout's settings. Click on the settings (those three horizontal lines in upper right corner).  Now check that you have everything displaying correctly:\n\n\n\n\nRender Basal\n is set to either default or icicle (totally personal preference for how the temp basals show as blue lines in NS site)\n\n\nTheme is set to Colors\n\n\nCheck the boxes that you\u2019d like display pills in the SHOW PLUGINS (usually all of them except Openaps) section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the settings changes and you'll be on your way! Congrats!!\n\n\nStep 8: Loop Settings\n\u2301\n\n\nDon't forget to enter your new Nightscout site into your Loop settings! That way Loop can upload all the juicy great info directly to your Nightscout site (except CGM data...that is all handled by that BRIDGE info you put in earlier)\n\n\nDirections \nhere\n as well as warnings about the two most common errors when people add the URL to Loop settings. (Hint hint hint)\n\n\nDIY Troubleshooting\n\u2301\n\n\nIf your site is not showing CGM (and Loop, if you are Looping) data within about 10 minutes of finishing your setup, then please follow these steps \nhere\n to troubleshoot.\n\n\nFuture warning (for DIY users)\n\u2301\n\n\nAt some point in the future months, your Nightscout site will likely stop in some quirky way...like CGM data won't be showing is the most common. This won't affect Looping, but it might be kind of annoying if you are a parent using Nightscout for remote info. The reason? The database Heroku gives us for free has some size limitations. After several months of Looping, you'll likely fill up that free amount of space and we will need to cleanout in order to make room.\n\n\nSo...keep it in your head that if you see something odd with your NS site (like no CGM even though Dexcom is working), then please check \nthis page to learn how you can cleanout the database\n.

Second, the Looper's iphone needs the slide on in iPhone Settings, General, Background App Refresh. If this is not enabled, the remote overrides will not enact if the Loop app is not actively open on the phone's main screen.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Apple Push Notifications\n\u2301\n\n\nThe next part of this will help your Loop app give permissions to your Nightscout site to remotely interact with it.\n\n1. Login to your \nApple developer account\n with the Apple ID associated with your developer team that you used to sign your Loop app.\n\n2. Click on \"Certificates, Indentifiers \n Profiles\" and then, on the next page, click on \"Keys\" (located on the left-hand column). Click on the blue \"Create a new key\" \nOR\n the \"+\" icon to add a new key. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. In the form that appears, click the checkbox for enabling \"Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)\" and enter a name for the key such as \"Nightscout\". Then click the \"Continue\" button in the upper right of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. In the screen that follows, click the blue \"Register\" button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. In the screen that follows, click the blue \"Download\" button. This step will download a file with a name that starts with \"AuthKey\" and ends with \".p8\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Find your AuthKey download in your downloads folder. Double-click to open it and you will be presented a message asking how you'd like to open it. Click on \"Choose Application...\" and then select \"TextEdit\" as your application to open it with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. When the file opens, it will look similar to the screenshot below. In a few minutes, after we do a few other steps first, we will need to highlight \nALL OF THE CONTENTS\n of that file and copy it because we will be pasting it in Heroku. Yes, allllll of the contents. So, easiest way is to click inside that file and then press \ncommand-a\n to highlight all the text and then \ncommand-c\n to copy it all to the clipboard. You don't have to do it right now...just keep that window open in the background for now until we need it a little further down. Then we will copy all that text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Update Nightscout site\n\u2301\n\n\nYou'll need to update your Nightscout site to use the latest version of cgm-remote-monitor. It is called Ketchup and the version number is 13.0.1. You can check your version number by looking at the bottom of your NS site's settings, near where the authentication button is located. The easiest way to do to update your Nightscout site is to follow the steps in the video below.\n\n\n\n\nUse this video for an easy process to update your Nightscout site:\n\n\n\nEasy Nightscout Update Video\n\n\nA quick note about the video instructions:\n\n \nIf you don't see any branches to select to deploy and are missing the deploy button when you get to that step...you need to do one easy step. Select/click the \"GitHub\" icon from the middle of your Heroku screen. Then enter your GitHub account name to connect to that account. Once connected to your account, enter \ncgm-remote-monitor\n as the repo you'd like to use to connect with specifically. That will fix the issue and you'll then see the deploy buttons like in the video.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have your Nightscout deployment updated to the latest master branch of cgm-remote-monitor, now we need to add a couple new variables.\n\n\nGo to the \nSettings\n tab near the top of the screen on your Heroku app and then click on \nReveal Config Vars\n.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down the bottom of the Config Vars lines until you find the last blank one.  You are going to add three new rows of config vars for remote overrides as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEY\n\n\nVALUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOOP_APNS_KEY\n\n\nenter ENTIRE contents of the downloaded .p8 file including the BEGIN and END lines. Here's where you can use the \ncommand-a\n and \ncommand-c\n to hightlight and copy all the text in that file so you can paste it into Heroku here for this new variable you are creating.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOOP_APNS_KEY_ID\n\n\nstring of characters on the .p8 download file immediately following the underscore (  _  ) and not including the file extension ( .p8 ), or you can get it from your saved key in your developer account as shown next step, too\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOOP_DEVELOPER_TEAM_ID\n\n\nget this value from Loop app signing or in your developer account's top right corner under your name\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen executed properly, you should have something that looks like this for your three new variables that you added:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: FAQs on Remote Overrides\n\u2301\n\n\nDon't forget to read Loopdocs pages about how regular overrides work. For remote overrides in particular:\n\n\n\n\nCan I set different override in Nighscout than I have programmed into Loop app?\n Answer: No. You will only be able to enact override presets already programmed into the Loop app.\n\n\nIf I didn't start the override in Nightscout (it was started in Loop itself), can I still use Nightscout to cancel it?\n Answer: Yes. You can cancel a Loop-set override with a Nightscout-set cancel \"temporary override\" command in careportal.\n\n\n\"Can I override a Loop-set override with a Nightscout-set override?\"\n Answer: Yes. \n\n\nIf I have multiple Nightscout sites because I have multiple kiddos with T1D looping, do I need multiple APNs Keys?\n Answer: No. If you have multiple kids looping, you can use the one APNs key in each of their Nightscout sites. \n\n\nHow can I tell if it worked?\n Answer: You should see your override pill in Nightscout, with the NEXT Loop cycle, reflecting that the desired override action took place. If you are near the Loop app, you should see the new override within less than 30 seconds or so.\n\n\n\n\nCan I set see on Nightscout when a temporary override has been set using the looper\u2019s phone?\n Yes. There will be a grey bar with the name of the override noted and the Loop Pill will display the targets and duration. Remember, there is a KNOWN issue with the grey bars, so use the pill as your best guide. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan a looper cancel a remote override\n? Yes. They can tap the heart icon in Loop so that it is no longer highlighted. This turns off the override, regardless of where it was initiated. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI set a remote override in Nightscout but the looper tapped the heart symbol in the Loop app, so the override turned off. Will the override get reinstated next time Loop completes with internet access?\n No. The APN is only sent once. You can set the remote override again if need be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I schedule a remote override ahead of time using Nightscout?\n No. When you set a remote override in Nightscout, it will begin immediately and last for whatever duration is programmed for that override in the Loop app. You can set an override for ahead of time using the Looping App only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Using Remote Overrides\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are three ways you can trigger your override presets remotely; careportal, Shortcuts, and IFTTT.\n\n\nCareportal\n\u2301\n\n\nTo use remote overrides, I'm assuming you've setup your Nightscout site according to the directions \nhere\n in Loopdocs. Especially the part about your ENABLE line including \"override careportal loop\" (in addition to other variables you'd be interested in). You'll also need to have your site authenticated so that your careportal is active to send remote overrides. You can authenticate your site by selecting the three horizontal lines in the upper right corner of your Nightscout site and scrolling to the bottom of the settings. There's an \"authenicate\" link at the very bottom. Once authenticated by entering your API Secret, then there will be a \n+\n in the upper right corner of your site. That is your careportal. Tap the careportal \n+\n and then scroll down in the \"event type\" menu to find \"Temporary Override\". Within there, you will find all your Loop override presets already loaded for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Looper will see a banner notification that an override has been set (or canceled, as the case may be).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanceling an override through Nightscout careportal is as simple as selecting the event type \"Temporary Override Cancel\" and submitting. \n\n\nShortcuts\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you want to make your life SUPER AMAZING, check out using the iPhone's Shortcuts app. The Shortcuts app is for making little automations (like mini apps) that can integrate parts of your life. In this case, we've written a couple shortcuts for you that integrate Loop overrides with Nightscout. \n\n\n\n\nImportant note\n\n\nBefore you click that download below...save some trouble. Download the Shortcuts app if you don't have it yet and choose to run any shortcut from the Gallery. It can be the laundry timer...I don't care, just pick one and run it.  THEN go to download the shortcut of your choice below. The shortcuts that aren't run through the Gallery option are called \"untrusted\". And you need a slider in your iPhone to trust the \"untrusted\" shortcuts you would be downloading here. But...in lovely iOS glitch...that slider doesn't appear unless you've run a trusted shortcut first. So, run one now. Then you'll have the slider in iPhone Settings, Shortcuts app to turn \"Allow Untrusted Shortcuts\" on when you will see a message \"This shortcut cannot be opened because your Shortcuts security system settings don't allow untrusted shortcuts.\"\n\n\n\n\nClick these links on your iphone and you'll be prompted to download the premade shortcuts (assuming you open the links in Safari browser in iPhone):\n\n\nComprehensive Loop Shortcut\n\n \nincludes Set Remote Override, Cancel Override, Loop Troubleshooting Tips, Quick Text options, Manual BG entry, Bookmarks to websites, etc.\n\n\nAnd if you want to save one click to get to these one functions more directly: these shortcuts are simplified to offer only one function:\n\n\nSet Remote Override only shortcut\n\n\nCancel Override only shortcut\n\n\nA couple notes about these shortcuts:\n\n\n\n\nYou will need iOS 13 at a minimum on the phone you'd like to trigger these shortcuts from. Looper's phone can still be lower than iOS 13, but your phone as the shortcut user would need iOS 13.\n\n\nYou need to open those links in the Safari browser on your iPhone. When you do that click the button to get the shortcut. Then wait a bit, and the shortcut's inner guts will be there...scroll ALL the way down to the bottom to click the button to save the untrusted shortcut.\n\n\nWhen you enter your Nightscout URL in the \"URL\" field of the Loop shortcut setup, make sure you don't include a trailing \"/\" or the API calls to Heroku will error out. \n\n\nWhen a remote override is set properly, you'll see an \"ok\" message displayed. If there is an error, you'll see an error message. Most errors will be that you have an API secret wrong (make sure there isn't a space at the end of you API Secret that you don't see) or you failed to do the steps to setup NS and update your Loop app as described in steps 1-3 above.\n\n\nYou can absolutely customize these bits and pieces within the shortcut. Change the text messages, change the links...totally up to you.\n\n\n\n\nIFTTT\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you want to walk uphill both ways in the snow carrying bags of uneven groceries, you can also set overrides remotely by \nsetting up IFTTT\n, too.\n\n\nStep 6: Known Issues\n\u2301\n\n\nJust a brief mention so you are aware:\n\n\n\n\nThe override pill will display information about what override is currently active in the Looper's phone. BUT, there can be a slight delay as that information is only transmitted every 5 minutes at best (it is tied to Loop runs and Nightscout upload events in Loop). So, wait 5 minutes to see that the information has gone through a refresh cycle before assuming the override message failed to enact.\n\n\nWhen you add a new override preset in Loop, that preset has to be uploaded to Nightscout before it will be available as a remote override. To trigger that upload, you can simply enact that new override for a few seconds and turn it off again. that will get the Nightscout upload going.\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Common Errors\n\u2301\n\n\nOnce you've set up remote overrides, you may encounter errors when trying to run them via Nightscout or iOS Shortcuts.  Below are the most common and the typical solutions.\n\n\n\n\nError: Loop notification failed: Could not find deviceToken in loopSettings\n You might see this in either Nightscout or Shortcuts.  The error is most commonly caused by 3 issues: incorrect version of Loop, Loop is not pointing to the right Nightscout instance, or you haven't yet run an override locally (with the Loop app) before trying to run one remotely.  \nSolution:\n check you have the latest version of the Dev branch installed, confirm the Loop app is pointing to the right Nightscout site (and there are not extra spaces or a slash (/) at the end, and always run an override for a few seconds in the Loop app before you try to run one remotely.\n\n\nError: cannot POST/api/v2/notifications/loop\n You might see this in iOS Shortcuts.  This means Nightscout is not updated correctly and you are running a version of Nightscout that doesn't yet support remote overrides.  \nSolution:\n Follow the steps above again on how to update to the version of Nightscout that supports remote overrides.\n\n\nError: {\u201cstatus\u201d:401,\u201dmessage\u201d:\u201dUnauthorized\u201d,\u201ddescription\u201d:Invalid\\/Missing\u201d}\n You might see this in iOS Shortcuts.  This is caused by having the incorrect API Secret in the Shortcut.  \nSolution:\n Double check the API Secret is correct and that there are no spaces at the end.\n\n\nError: APNs delivery failed: InvalidProviderToken\n You might see this in either Nightscout or Shortcuts.  This is caused because your LOOP_APNS_KEY_ID and LOOP_DEVELOPER_TEAM_ID are swapped in Heroku.  \nSolution:\n Double check what's listed in your Apple Developer Account and compare to the config variables in Heroku. Your Team_ID is next to your name in the top right corner.  The other code is your Key_ID. Get the IDs in the correct location in Heroku to resolve the error.",

            "text": "Once you've set up remote overrides, you may encounter errors when trying to run them via Nightscout or iOS Shortcuts.  Below are the most common and the typical solutions.   Error: Loop notification failed: Could not find deviceToken in loopSettings  You might see this in either Nightscout or Shortcuts.  The error is most commonly caused by 3 issues: incorrect version of Loop, Loop is not pointing to the right Nightscout instance, or you haven't yet run an override locally (with the Loop app) before trying to run one remotely.   Solution:  check you have the latest version of the Dev branch installed, confirm the Loop app is pointing to the right Nightscout site (and there are not extra spaces or a slash (/) at the end, and always run an override for a few seconds in the Loop app before you try to run one remotely.  Error: cannot POST/api/v2/notifications/loop  You might see this in iOS Shortcuts.  This means Nightscout is not updated correctly and you are running a version of Nightscout that doesn't yet support remote overrides.   Solution:  Follow the steps above again on how to update to the version of Nightscout that supports remote overrides.  Error: {\u201cstatus\u201d:401,\u201dmessage\u201d:\u201dUnauthorized\u201d,\u201ddescription\u201d:Invalid\\/Missing\u201d}  You might see this in iOS Shortcuts.  This is caused by having the incorrect API Secret in the Shortcut.   Solution:  Double check the API Secret is correct and that there are no spaces at the end.  Error: APNs delivery failed: InvalidProviderToken  You might see this in either Nightscout or Shortcuts.  This is caused because your LOOP_APNS_KEY_ID and LOOP_DEVELOPER_TEAM_ID are swapped in Heroku.   Solution:  Double check what's listed in your Apple Developer Account and compare to the config variables in Heroku. Your Team_ID is next to your name in the top right corner.  The other code is your Key_ID. Get the IDs in the correct location in Heroku to resolve the error.",

By using IFTTT, you can have single button presses on your iPhone that will set an override, log a cannula change, log a sensor change and much more. \n\n\nStep 1: Get your API Secret Hash\n\u2301\n\n\nFirst we need to gather one thing called your \"hashed API Secret\". In your internet browser, open a \"console\" window while viewing your Nightscout site.  Make sure you have \"authenticated\" your site by using your API secret in the Nightscout settings area (hint: if you see a little padlock in the upper left corner of the site, you haven't authenticated it).  Refresh the site and your hashed secret key will be shown as \"apisecrethash: \"xxxxxxxxxx...\"\"  \n\n\nFor Safari users on Mac\n, you can open the console window by selecting \"Develop\" from the Safari top menu, and then \"Show Page Source\" (if you do not see \"Develop\" in the top menu, activate it by going to Safari \n Preferences... \n Advanced, and checking the \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\" option).  If you're having problems seeing the apisecrethash, click the little grey triangle next to the \"status isAuthenticated\" line and the objects below it will display (see screenshot).  Your hashed API secret can be copied and pasted from that line, as shown below.  Save that somewhere easy to get to again, because you will be using it later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Chrome users\n, the console window is found through the View \n Developer \n View Source. Click on the Console tab and scroll to find the \"status isAuthenticated\" row to find your apisecrethash. Copy your API hash to somewhere you can retreive it again, we will be copy/pasting it in Step 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Create your \"Applets\"\n\u2301\n\n\nIFTTT calls their little actions that you'll create an \"applet\". I have no idea why. But, I will go along and use their terminology so we are all consistent. We are basically interested in creating applets that will be buttons on your phone to do cool things in Nightscout. So, you'll have a button that will log when you changed your sensor last...letting you see in Nightscout easily just how old a sensor is at any given time. Or you can create a button that will turn on an \"exercise\" override that you already programmed into your kid's Loop app. So, let's make our first applet (aka button).\n\n\n\n\nGet an \nIFTTT account\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin to your IFTTT.com account and select click \nthis link\n to get to the page for creating your first \"New Applet\". (You can also get to this Applet creation page by selecting your Account icon in the upper right of the IFTTT website, then clicking on \"Create\".)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the screen that appears, click on the black \"+this\" part of the screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next screen, type \"button\" in the search field and then click on the red box labelled \"ButtonWidget\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the button widget by clicking on the large black\"connect\" button twice, once on the main screen and then second on the pop-up window that will appear immediately after that. (You will only have to \"connect\" the widgets for the first applet you make.  After that the widgets will already connected to your IFTTT account.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the large red \"button press\" box \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the black \"+that\" text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter \"Webhooks\" in the search field and click on the Webhooks app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the Webhooks app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the blue \"Make a Web Request\" box\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you will have a blank web request template to complete.  Screenshot below is an example of a completed recipe for eating soon IFTTT action. There are four parts you will need to fill in, and they are described below the screenshot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nURL\n\n\nhttps://yoursite.herokuapp.com/api/v1/treatments.json\n (for all IFTTT recipes that are NOT remote overrides...so things like cannula changes, sensor changes, pump battery changes, etc.)\n\nChange the \"yoursite\" to your actual site's info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\nThe method will be \nPOST\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Type\n\n\nThe content type will be \napplication/json\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody\n\n\nThe content of the body will depend on the action that you would like this particular button press to perform. While many recipes are available, any recipe that log carbs to NS will only display the carbs in Nightscout...Loop will not \"use\" those carbs in treatment or prediction math. The display of carbs in NS though may still be helpful for remote care givers to leave an indication that a low is being noticed and treated.  Some sample content for actions that may be useful in Loop:\n\n\nPump Site Change\n\n{\"enteredBy\": \"IFTTT-button\", \"eventType\": \"Site Change\", \"duration\": 0, \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"}\n\n\nCGM Sensor Start\n\n{\"enteredBy\": \"IFTTT-button\", \"eventType\": \"Sensor Start\", \"duration\": 0, \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"}\n\n\nNote\n\n{\"enteredBy\": \"IFTTT-button\", \"eventType\": \"Note\", \"notes\": \"Hi mom, please don't text me for a bit.  I'm taking a test.\", \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial note for IFTTT to set a Remote Override with dev branch\n\n\nTriggering a remote override with IFTTT takes a couple considerations;\n\n1. You have followed \nthe directions for setting up remote overrides\n in Nightscout already.\n\n2. Remote overrides will use \nhttps://yoursite.herokuapp.com/api/v2/notifications/loop\n for the URL line of the applet. Notice that is different from the other type of applets' URL.\n\n3. The Body message of the applet needs to match the override already programmed in Loop app; the reason, reasonDisplay, and duration all need to match what is preset in your Loop app. The \"duration\" is giving in minutes in the body message (vs hours in Loop), and if the override is one that is \"enabled indefinitely\" then the duration is \"infinite\". The \"reason\" is the name of the override but NO EMOJI, and the \"reasonDisplay\" is the override name with the emoji. Check out the samples Body messages for overrides below. You will have to edit your body messages to match your reason and reasonDisplay. The target range and duration of the override does not need to be specified. \n\n\nBody message for override named \"hormones\"\n\n{\"eventType\": \"Temporary Override\", \"reason\": \"hormones\", \"reasonDisplay\": \"\ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2640\ufe0f hormones\", \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"}\n\n\nBody message for override named \"running\"\n\n{\"eventType\": \"Temporary Override\", \"reason\": \"running\", \"reasonDisplay\": \"\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f running\", \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"}\n\n\nBody message for override named \"Low Treatment\"\n\n{\"eventType\": \"Temporary Override\", \"reason\": \"Low Treatment\", \"reasonDisplay\": \"\ud83c\udf6c Low Treatment\", \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"}\n\n\nBody message to cancel any override\n\n{\"eventType\": \"Temporary Override Cancel\", \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nCreate Action\n button on the bottom of the screen when you finish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow is your chance to change the title of your applet now to something meaningful.  You can turn on notifications, too, using the slider shown. If you turn on the notifications, you will get an alert on your phone and pebble watch when the button press has been successfully deployed.  Finish the IFTTT button by clicking on the Finish button that appears.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the setup for new applets for as many automated actions/overrides as you would like to setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Enable IFTTT in your Nightscout site\n\u2301\n\n\nNow that we have cool applets made, we need to give Nightscout some information so that it will accept commands from our applets. It's pretty simple to do...just a couple additions to your Heroku settings.\n\n\n\n\nFind your Maker Key by going to your IFTTT account icon in upper right corner, choose \"My services\" and then click on the Webhooks service, settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nYou will see your Maker Key as the last part of the URL after the \nuse/\n; copy and paste that last part (the red circled part as shown)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin to your Nightscout site host (azure or heroku) and (1) add your Maker Key to the MAKER_KEY line and (2) add \"maker\" to your ENABLE line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Install IFTTT app on your iPhone/Android\n\u2301\n\n\nNow that all the hard work is done, we can take easy street and just add that work to the phone via the IFTTT app. By accessing the IFTTT widget on your iPhone, you'll be able to easily and quickly access the useful buttons you've just created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the IFTTT app on your phone and log in using your IFTTT account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor iPhone users, if you swipe right from your iPhone's home screen, you will have the Today view showing.  Scroll to the bottom, click \"edit\". This should show a list of existing widgets, followed by a list of \"more widgets\" with green + signs.  Click on the IFTTT's green circle and the widget will be moved to the top, active widgets area.  You can hold your finger on the three left lines of the IFTTT widget row to drag it to the top of your widget panel, if you prefer to have it as the top-most widget. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you end up with more than four IFTTT applets, they will appear in reverse-order of when they were created...which may not be the same as you'd prefer them to appear on your widget bar.  If you'd like to reorder them:\n\n\n\n\ngo into your iPhone's IFTTT app\n\n\nclick on My Applets\n\n\nclick on the gear icon in upper left of screen\n\n\nclick on Widgets\n\n\nclick on the pencil icon in upper right of screen\n\n\nclick and hold the three lines that appear on the right side of the widget that you want to move.  Drag the widget to the order in the list that you'd like it to appear in your widget quickscreen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra Credit: Alexa integration\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nSince you have IFTTT/Maker requests working, you can get it to work with anything that supports IFTTT, including Alexa. You will need to add \"alexa\" to your ENABLE line in your Heroku settings.  And then repeat the steps above, but instead of using \"ButtonWidget\" service we started with earlier (the \"+if\" part of the setup)...you will use the \"AmazonAlexa\" service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexa requests do not need underscores, FYI.",

We can achieve this functionality through a combination of Nightscout, IFTTT, Google, and Pushover.\n\n\nTraditionally, most people may already know of Pushover alerts through their NS site.  The old Loop docs had set up for how to add your \nPUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY\n , \nPUSHOVER_API_TOKEN\n, and \nPUSHOVER_USER_KEY\n in your Heroku settings to get notifications on the non-looping phones of parents and caregivers.  The drawback for that method is that you could not necessarily fine-tune the alerts (maybe you wanted battery alarms on your NS website, but not get pushovers for them...a bit hard to separate out the environments that way) and Pushover had a demanding acknowledgment requirement.  If you failed to acknowledge an alert, you may end up getting alarm fatigue fairly quickly as the alarm repeated itself.\n\n\nUsing Pushover \nTHROUGH\n IFTTT however, we can improve the possible notifications and who receives which ones.  For example, a teenage Looper may want notifications when his/her pump site needs changing and when his/her Dexcom is about to expire in the next day.  S/he already gets local notifications on his/her phone via Loop for low reservoir volumes, low pump battery, and Loop failures.  Dexcom app provides high/low BG notifications locally, too.  If s/he were to get those same alarms via Pushover, s/he would inevitably get alarm fatigue.  A remotely-monitoring parent may want additional information, like a pushover alert when the school nurse boluses for lunch, as well as Loop failures, low iPhone battery level for the child, low pump battery, and other such information that might be useful.  Perhaps there's also an emergency contact person that you only want to get high/low BG alerts...you can set that up as well quite easily.\n\n\nThe basic concept is that NS puts out an event that triggers the IFTTT service called Webhooks (old name was \"Maker Webhooks\" hence you may see references to \"maker\" in NS docs).  Actually, there are several types of events that NS has programmed in all ready to use in IFTTT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this setup, we are going to use the most general logging event called \nns-event\n.  You'll get all the alarms and notifications logged, and then you can decide in subsequent steps which ones you'd actually like to send to your phone for pushover notification.\n\n\nAs a brief roadmap for what we are going to do:\n\n\n\n\nGet necessary accounts setup\n\n\nAdd a folder to your Google Drive\n\n\nMake an IFTTT applet to log NS events to your Google Spreadsheets\n\n\nEnable NS to work with that new IFTTT applet\n\n\nMake an IFTTT applet to send Pushover alert when the Google Spreadsheet is updated\n\n\n\n\nGet Prepped\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you don't already have these steps done, you will need them.  Skip any that you already have done.\n\n\n\n\nSetup a Nightscout site\n\n\nGet an \nIFTTT account\n\n\nGet a \nPushover Account\n\n\nGet a \nGoogle Account\n\n\nDownload the Pushover app onto your phone, and any other phone you'd like to receive Pushover alerts\n\n\nDownload the IFTTT app onto your phone, and any other phone you'd like to use IFTTT applets on\n\n\nLogin to the Pushover and IFTTT apps with your login information\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Google Drive folder\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nLogin to your Google account and select Google Drive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the blue \"New\" button and create a new folder named IFTTT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the newly created IFTTT folder, select the blue \"New\" button again, and create a new subfolder called \"Nightscout-Alarms\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms folder will eventually contain numerous Google Spreadsheets, one for each NS alarm or information that is logged.  As new alarms are triggered, the IFTTT applet we are about to write will add a row to the appropriate spreadsheet logging the time of the alarm and any other reported details that go with the entry.  For now though, your drive will be blank...screenshot below just to give you an idea of where we are going.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake 1st IFTTT Applet to Log NS Alarms\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nLogin to your IFTTT.com account and select the \"New Applet\" button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the screen that appears, click on the blue \"+this\" part of the screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next screen, type \"webhooks\" in the search field and then click on the blue connect button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this is the first time you are using IFTTT Webhooks service, you will have a \"Connect\" button to select.

(Side note:  the event name used here corresponds to the triggers discussed above for core events that NS already has integrated for IFTTT users.  If you want to, instead, use the other triggers such as ns-warn or ns-urgent, you can.

For the \"Spreadsheet Name\", click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and select the \"Value1\".  For the \"Drive folder path\", enter \nIFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms\n.  You do not have to modify the \"Formatted row\" box's contents.  Click the \"Create action\" button at the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn off the toggle for receiving notifications when the applet runs, and then click the Finish button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll now have the finished IFTTT applet that will cause a row to be added to a Google spreadsheet...tracking all your NS notifications and alarms.  If it is the first time that alarm has been logged, the applet will also create the spreadsheet itself.  After a while, your IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms folder will start to look like the screenshot posted above with numerous spreadsheets for each alarm type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable IFTTT Webhooks in your Nightscout site\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nIf you already have created IFTTT buttons previously to work with your NS site, you can skip this section.  If those buttons are working, then you've already added your MAKER_KEY and \"maker\" to your ENABLE line in Heroku.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo actually make that first applet work, we need to enter a \"Maker Key\" to get NS and IFTTT talking to each other.  Find your Maker Key by going to your IFTTT account, Services and then clicking on Webhooks.  (Your screen may not have as many services showing; the example account below just happens to already use several services.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see your Maker Key as the last part of the URL; copy that last part (the red circled part)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your Heroku account's settings tab, \"reveal config vars\" and (1) add your Maker Key to the MAKER_KEY line and (2) add \"maker\" to your ENABLE line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake 2nd IFTTT Applet to send Pushover notifications\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nIn your IFTTT account, select the \"New Applet\" button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the screen that appears, click on the blue \"+this\" part of the screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next screen, type \"google\" in the search field and then click on the \"Google Sheets\" logo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \"New row added to spreadsheet\" as the trigger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the following information:  Folder path is \nIFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms\n and for the filename you are going to enter the name of the particular NS alarm or information that you would like to get pushover alerts for.  Click on the \"Create trigger\" button to save the trigger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis applet can't be created unless your filename (alarm spreadsheet) already exists.  If your 1st applet we created above hasn't run for a long time, the spreadsheets may not exist yet because the alarms haven't triggered.  You have two options...(1) manually create the file in your Google Drive so that you can finish the applet now or (2) wait several days/weeks for the alarms to happen and that will automatically create the files in your Google drive.\n\nIf you choose option 1, here's a partial list of some of the filenames you could create in advance:\n\n\n\n\nLoop isn't looping\n\n\nCannula age 48 hours\n\n\nCannula age 72 hours\n\n\nMeal Bolus\n\n\nWarning, Pump Reservoir Low\n\n\nWarning Uploader Battery is Low\n\n\nTemporary Override\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your alert levels you specified in NS, some of the hours in the titles may vary to match your settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the blue \"+that\" text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter \npushover\n in the search field and click on the Pushover icon.  If this is your first time linking your IFTTT to Pushover, you will be prompted to enter your Pushover account login and allow IFTTT access.  This only needs to be done once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \"Send a Pushover notification\" box\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete the contents of the \"Title\" and \"Message\" and \"URL\" boxes.  For the Title, click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and add \nColumnC\n.  For the \"Message\", click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and add the values of various columns from your spreadsheet for the information you would like to include.  For the alerts: \nColumnC\n contains the alarm name, \nColumnA\n is the date/time of the alarm, and \nColumnD\n has more detailed information about the info/alarm.  This is a pretty decent recipe to follow to get the useful information in your notification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \"Message Priority\" that you would like for this particular alarm type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \"Device\" that you would like to receive this particular alarm type.  The devices listed will be all your devices that have Pushover app installed and logged into.  Click \"Create Action\" when you are finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll now have made the IFTTT applet that will cause a Pushover notification to a particular device for a particular NS alarm, once the first applet records the alarm in the google spreadsheet.  Keep the \"receive notification when this Applet runs\" toggled off and click the Finish button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevisit Nightscout Alert Levels\n\u2301\n\n\nPutting all these notifications together may cause you to want to revisit the alert levels you have set in your Heroku settings.  Here's a short summary of NS for the looping-related alerts (Note: the last row, Upbat, is the Looping iPhone battery level for Loop users; or the rig's battery level for OpenAPS users.)  If you'd like some of these alarms for your site and don't currently have them activated (they are all off by default unless specifically turned on), the lines you'd need to add are in the last column.  If you like the default values of the WARN and/or URGENT, you don't have to add those extra lines...just the line to enable the alerts will be sufficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSETTING\n\n\nDEFAULT\nWARN\n\n\nDEFAULT\nURGENT\n\n\nHEROKU\nSETTINGS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAGE\n\n\n48\n\n\n72\n\n\nCAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nCAGE_WARN=XX\nCAGE_URGENT=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAGE\n\n\n164\n\n\n168\n\n\nSAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nSAGE_WARN=XX\nSAGE_URGENT=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIAGE\n\n\n48\n\n\n72\n\n\nIAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nIAGE_WARN=XX\nIAGE_URGENT=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOOP\n\n\n30\n\n\n60\n\n\nLOOP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nLOOP_WARN=XX\nLOOP_URGENT=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPENAPS\n\n\n30\n\n\n60\n\n\nOPENAPS_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nOPENAPS_WARN=XX\nOPENAPS_URGENT=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUMP_CLOCK\n\n\n30\n\n\n60\n\n\nPUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nPUMP_WARN_CLOCK=XX\nPUMP_URGENT_CLOCK=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUMP_RES\n\n\n10\n\n\n5\n\n\nPUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nPUMP_WARN_RES=XX\nPUMP_URGENT_RES=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUMP_BATT_P\n\n\n30\n\n\n20\n\n\nPUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nPUMP_WARN_BATT_P=XX\nPUMP_URGENT_BATT_P=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUMP_BATT_V\n\n\n1.35\n\n\n1.30\n\n\nPUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nPUMP_WARN_BATT_V=XX\nPUMP_URGENT_BATT_V=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPBAT\n\n\n30\n\n\n20\n\n\nUPBAT_ENABLE_ALERTS = true\nUPBAT_WARN=XX\nUPBAT_URGENT=XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal notes\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use other notification services than Pushover in the last part of the second applet.  For example, you could use the SMS service to send text notifications to your iPhone instead of Pushover.  The downside for that is that the SMS service is limited to 100 message each month...some users may exceed that pretty easily.  Another alternative notification would be IFTTT's own Notification service.  This would work well, but does not have the ability to distinguish between devices the way Pushover allows.  If you use IFTTT's Notifications service, every phone using your IFTTT account will get the notices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, you do \nNOT\n need to have pushover on your ENABLE line nor have \nPUSHOVER_USER_KEY\n, \nPUSHOVER_API_TOKEN\n, or \nPUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY\n entered into your Heroku settings in order for any of the above to work.  This is not the same Pushover as NS has integrated into its code.  This is actually through IFTTT services, you just need a Pushover account to link to during the 2nd applet setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create more notifications, simply repeat the steps for the 2nd applet you created, only this time use a new filename that corresponds to the spreadsheet tracking the alert you'd like notifications for.  You'll end up with multiple applets of the dark blue type (the pushover notifiers) and only a single light blue (NS alarm general collector).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are examples of the Meal Bolus and Temp Basal ns-event logging spreadsheets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1st applet can only create up to 2000 active rows in a given spreadsheet.  After that, the applet will automatically create a new spreadsheet.  For most alarms, it may take quite some time to reach 2000 rows of info.  For other alerts, such as temp basals being set, that may fill up rather fast for the average looper.  You can either clean out the data rows periodically to make room, or update your filename in the 2nd applet periodically when a new spreadsheet is made.",

            "text": "While Loop app currently sends notifications locally on Loop user's iPhone, parents and caregivers likely want those messages on their phones, too.  We can achieve this functionality through a combination of Nightscout, IFTTT, Google, and Pushover.  Traditionally, most people may already know of Pushover alerts through their NS site.  The old Loop docs had set up for how to add your  PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY  ,  PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN , and  PUSHOVER_USER_KEY  in your Heroku settings to get notifications on the non-looping phones of parents and caregivers.  The drawback for that method is that you could not necessarily fine-tune the alerts (maybe you wanted battery alarms on your NS website, but not get pushovers for them...a bit hard to separate out the environments that way) and Pushover had a demanding acknowledgment requirement.  If you failed to acknowledge an alert, you may end up getting alarm fatigue fairly quickly as the alarm repeated itself.  Using Pushover  THROUGH  IFTTT however, we can improve the possible notifications and who receives which ones.  For example, a teenage Looper may want notifications when his/her pump site needs changing and when his/her Dexcom is about to expire in the next day.  S/he already gets local notifications on his/her phone via Loop for low reservoir volumes, low pump battery, and Loop failures.  Dexcom app provides high/low BG notifications locally, too.  If s/he were to get those same alarms via Pushover, s/he would inevitably get alarm fatigue.  A remotely-monitoring parent may want additional information, like a pushover alert when the school nurse boluses for lunch, as well as Loop failures, low iPhone battery level for the child, low pump battery, and other such information that might be useful.  Perhaps there's also an emergency contact person that you only want to get high/low BG alerts...you can set that up as well quite easily.

SETTING  DEFAULT WARN  DEFAULT URGENT  HEROKU SETTINGS      CAGE  48  72  CAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true CAGE_WARN=XX CAGE_URGENT=XX    SAGE  164  168  SAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true SAGE_WARN=XX SAGE_URGENT=XX    IAGE  48  72  IAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true IAGE_WARN=XX IAGE_URGENT=XX    LOOP  30  60  LOOP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true LOOP_WARN=XX LOOP_URGENT=XX    OPENAPS  30  60  OPENAPS_ENABLE_ALERTS = true OPENAPS_WARN=XX OPENAPS_URGENT=XX    PUMP_CLOCK  30  60  PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true PUMP_WARN_CLOCK=XX PUMP_URGENT_CLOCK=XX    PUMP_RES  10  5  PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true PUMP_WARN_RES=XX PUMP_URGENT_RES=XX    PUMP_BATT_P  30  20  PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true PUMP_WARN_BATT_P=XX PUMP_URGENT_BATT_P=XX    PUMP_BATT_V  1.35  1.30  PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true PUMP_WARN_BATT_V=XX PUMP_URGENT_BATT_V=XX    UPBAT  30  20  UPBAT_ENABLE_ALERTS = true UPBAT_WARN=XX UPBAT_URGENT=XX",

            "text": "You can use other notification services than Pushover in the last part of the second applet.  For example, you could use the SMS service to send text notifications to your iPhone instead of Pushover.  The downside for that is that the SMS service is limited to 100 message each month...some users may exceed that pretty easily.  Another alternative notification would be IFTTT's own Notification service.  This would work well, but does not have the ability to distinguish between devices the way Pushover allows.  If you use IFTTT's Notifications service, every phone using your IFTTT account will get the notices.    To be clear, you do  NOT  need to have pushover on your ENABLE line nor have  PUSHOVER_USER_KEY ,  PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN , or  PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY  entered into your Heroku settings in order for any of the above to work.  This is not the same Pushover as NS has integrated into its code.  This is actually through IFTTT services, you just need a Pushover account to link to during the 2nd applet setup.    To create more notifications, simply repeat the steps for the 2nd applet you created, only this time use a new filename that corresponds to the spreadsheet tracking the alert you'd like notifications for.  You'll end up with multiple applets of the dark blue type (the pushover notifiers) and only a single light blue (NS alarm general collector).        Here are examples of the Meal Bolus and Temp Basal ns-event logging spreadsheets          The 1st applet can only create up to 2000 active rows in a given spreadsheet.  After that, the applet will automatically create a new spreadsheet.  For most alarms, it may take quite some time to reach 2000 rows of info.  For other alerts, such as temp basals being set, that may fill up rather fast for the average looper.  You can either clean out the data rows periodically to make room, or update your filename in the 2nd applet periodically when a new spreadsheet is made.",
