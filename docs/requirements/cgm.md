# Continuous Glucose Monitor

A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) provides Loop with current blood glucose readings.  These readings allow Loop to predict what the current glucose trend is, and predict the future glucose based on carbohydrate input and basal profiles. The following are the types of CGMs compatible with Loop.  CGM readings are a required part of looping.  If your Loop is unable to retreive BG data, it will not be able to loop.

## Dexcom G5 CGM <img src="../img/g5.jpg" width="150" alt="G5">

Dexcom G5 receives CGM data directly to the Dexcom G5 Mobile app on your iPhone via Bluetooth.  It does not require the use of a G5 stand-alone receiver.

## Dexcom G4 CGM with Share Receiver <img src="../img/g4_receiver.png" width="150" alt="G4 With Receiver">

Dexcom G4 Share system transmits CGM data from the transmitter to a Dexcom G4 Share Receiver.  The receiver, in turn, connects to the Dexcom Share2 app on your iPhone via Bluetooth.  The Share2 app uploads CGM data to the Dexcom servers.  

## Medtronic CGM <img src="../img/enlite.png" width="150" alt="Enlite">

The Minimed Enlite CGM, available with the Medtronic 523/723 and 554/754, wirelessly sends blood glucose readings to the pump.  Loop can read the Medtronic CGM data directly from the pump using the RileyLink.  

## Offline Use

Offline use means using Loop when there is no cell data or internet available.  For the offline Loop use, the iPhone's Bluetooth still needs to be active; and for Dexcom system's, the Share2 or G5 Mobile apps also still need to be active.  If you put your iPhone into Airplane mode, remember to turn back on the Bluetooth to keep your Loop running.

## Dexcom Servers

In some instances, the Loop may fail to eavesdrop on the Bluetooth transmissions of the CGM systems.  When that happens, the Loop can pull directly from Dexcom Servers to get the data (assuming you have entered your Share account information in the Loop settings).  When Loop is operating in this mode, you will see a small cloud in the CGM reading in the Loop app.  Operating in this mode requires a working internet or cell connection.
