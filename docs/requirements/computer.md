# Apple Computer

To build and install Loop onto your iPhone, you will need access to an Apple computer running OS X 10.11.5 or later.   “El Capitan” is OS X 10.11.  “Sierra” is the newly released OS X 10.12.  Access is only required when you are initially installing the Loop app, updating to a newer release, or making changes to the underlying Loop code.  You do NOT need access to an Apple computer in order to troubleshoot or change Loop settings, such as basal profiles or carb ratios.

Where can you find your computer’s OS X version?  Click on the Apple icon in the upper left corner of your Mac’s display.  Select “About This Mac” from the dropdown menu, and it will display the OS X version number.

If your computer is running an out-of-date OS X, you can read whether you can upgrade to the necessary OS X version [here](http://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/#hardware-requirements).  The degree to which you can upgrade an older Apple computer will depend on the age and model of the computer.
