# Apple Computer

Apple regularly updates their iPhone software (iOS), computer software (OSX) and Xcode application.  Depending on what version of those you are using on your iPhone, you may have to update your computer and Xcode to build Loop on your iPhone.

********
The most recent version of iOS is 10.3

The most recent version of OSX is 10.12 (called Sierra)

The most recent version of Xcode is 8.3

The most recent version of Loop is 1.3
*********
** If you are using iOS 10.3, you will need Xcode version 8.3 and Sierra (OSX 10.12).

** If you are using an older iOS, you can use older versions of Xcode (8.2 minimum), OSX (OSX 10.11.5 minimum).  

Computer access is only required when you are initially installing the Loop app, updating to a newer release, or making changes to the underlying Loop code.  You do NOT need access to an Apple computer in order to troubleshoot or change Loop settings, such as basal profiles or carb ratios.

Where can you find your computer’s OS X version?  Click on the Apple icon in the upper left corner of your Mac’s display.  Select “About This Mac” from the dropdown menu, and it will display the OS X version number.

If your computer is running an out-of-date OS X, you can read whether you can upgrade to the necessary OS X version [here](http://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/#hardware-requirements).  The degree to which you can upgrade an older Apple computer will depend on the age and model of the computer.
