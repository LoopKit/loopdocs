# Apple Computer

Apple regularly updates their iPhone software (iOS), computer software (OSX) and Xcode application.  Depending on what version of those you are using on your iPhone, you may have to update your computer and Xcode to build Loop on your iPhone.

********
The most recent version of iOS is 10.3.3

The most recent version of macOS is 10.12 (called Sierra)

The most recent version of Xcode is 8.3.3

The most recent version of Loop is 1.3.3

The most recent version of watchOS is 3.2.3
*********

The way Apple updates tend to happen is that one equipment's update will tend to require updating other pieces of Apple equipment.  For example, if you update your iOS on the iPhone, you may need an updated version of Xcode to install a new Loop app onto your phone.  And the new Xcode will require the volunteer developers of Loop to make updates to the Loop source code.  Finally, new Xcode updates also frequently come with macOS updates on your computer.

We do not recommend installing beta releases of Xcode, iOS or macOS on devices running Loop.  If you are considering an update to your Loop app, check to make sure your computer and Xcode have any available updates installed prior to building the new app.

Computer access is only required when you are initially installing the Loop app, updating to a newer release, or making changes to the underlying Loop code.  You do NOT need access to an Apple computer in order to troubleshoot or change Loop settings, such as basal profiles or carb ratios.

Where can you find your computer’s macOS version?  Click on the Apple icon in the upper left corner of your Mac’s display.  Select “About This Mac” from the dropdown menu, and it will display the macOS version number.

If your computer is running an out-of-date macOS, you can read whether you can upgrade to the necessary macOS version [here](http://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/#hardware-requirements).  The degree to which you can upgrade an older Apple computer will depend on the age and model of the computer.
