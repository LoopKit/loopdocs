# Overview

Loop has both Hardware and Software requirements.  In general, to use Loop you need to have six components.

- Compatible insulin pump
- Compatible CGM
- RileyLink
- Compatible iPhone/iPod Touch
- Apple computer running Mac OS X 10.11.5 or later
- Xcode (a free Apple application)

You will need to be able to install software on your computer and sign up as an Apple Developer to install the Loop app to your iPhone. You do not have to own an Apple computer to run Loop on a day-to-day basis, but you will need access to an Apple computer anytime you need to build or update your Loop app. For the most part, if you are comfortable with installing Apple software programs on your computer, you will have no problem building and running Loop. There are detailed step-by-step instructions included in these docs.  You should be doing this yourself so you can understand how to fix it when it breaks. You may want to help another person get set up on Loop, and that is noble, but you will serve them much better if you support them doing the work themselves, rather than doing it for them.
