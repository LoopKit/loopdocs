# Overview

Loop has both Hardware and Software requirements.  In general, to use Loop you need to have six components.

- Compatible insulin pump
- Compatible CGM
- RileyLink
- Compatible iPhone/iPod Touch
- Apple computer running Mac OS X 10.11.5 or later
- Xcode (a free Apple application)

You will need to be able to install software on your computer and possibly sign up as an Apple Developer to install the Loop app to your iPhone.  For the most part, if you are comfortable with installing software programs on your computer, you will have no problem building and running Loop. There are detailed step-by-step instructions included in this guide.  You should be doing this yourself so you can understand how to fix it WHEN it breaks. You may want to help another person get set up on Loop, and that is noble, but you will serve them much better if you support them doing the work themselves, rather than doing it for them.
