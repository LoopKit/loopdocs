### RileyLink (Required) <img src="../img/rileylink.png" width="150" alt="RileyLink">

The RileyLink is an open-source hardware device that can bridge Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to 916MHz wireless communication. What does that mean to you? It means RileyLink is the communication highway between your insulin pump, CGM, and iPhone.

The RileyLink is available as a set of PCB files and software, with instructions on how to build your own RileyLink hardware module.  All this can be found here: [RileyLink Github](https://github.com/ps2/rileylink)
If you aren’t up to the task of building your own RileyLink (and most of us aren’t), community members periodically do a production run of RileyLinks. You can place an order here: [RileyLink order site](https://getrileylink.org)
