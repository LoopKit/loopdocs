# Riley Link

## tuning

Note:  The strength of the radio communications with the pump is shown by the last number of the tune.  Tuning with -99 means NO communications were established.  Generally, if you have tuning in the -90s, your RileyLink-pump communications will not work.  If you have tuning in the -80s, you may have periodic communication failures.  If your tuning is in the -70s or better, your communications should be pretty stable.

If you ordered your RileyLink preassembled, you should plug in the battery cable.  Please make sure your RileyLinkâ€™s battery cable is securely pushed all the way into the socket.  Poor battery cable connection can make the Loop communications fail.
