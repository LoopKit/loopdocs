Loop provides the following local notifications on the Loop iPhone:

* Loop failures:  At 20, 40, 60, and 120 minutes, there is a Loop Failure notification. 

* Low Reservoir:  At 20% and 10% remaining reservoir volume, there is a Low Reservoir notification.

* Empty Reservoir:  Loop will notify when reservoir is empty.

* Low Battery: Loop will notify when battery levels have approximately 8-10 hours of battery life remaining.

* Bolus failures:  If Loop detects that a bolus was not able to be delivered, it will provide a notification.  Bolus failures are usually due to stale pump data.  Try fetching recent history from the RileyLink menu to update pump data.  Loop will also notify of partial bolus deliveries.

Loop does not have remote notification to other devices.  You can read the Remote Notifications section in the Nightscout area of these docs for information about how you can set them up.
