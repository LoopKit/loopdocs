Workout mode enables an alternate BG target range from what would normally be scheduled at the time. The alternate target can be enabled for 1 hour, 2 hours, or indefinitely. If you want more options for duration, you can customize them during your Loop build.

Some people use Workout mode to set temporarily higher targets ahead of exercise that would normally cause BG to drop.  This should give the user less chance of going low during exercise.

Another use for temporary targets is to prebolus for a meal by setting lower targets for an hour before a meal is expected.  Loop will use temp basals matched to the temporary lower target, and then before the meal is entered/bolused, the targets are adjusted back to normal.  This will leave the user with some active IOB going into the meal and help control post-prandial BG spikes.  Loop will account for the IOB when it makes the recommendation for the meal bolus (just remember to have the BG targets set back to normal before entering the meal carbs).

Finally, using a lower target for an hour or two (such as 80-80 mg/dl) may help in situations where you are “stuck” on a high BG from some temporary situation such as a bad carb count, slower food absorption, or anxiety from a short-term situation (work meeting, public presentation).
