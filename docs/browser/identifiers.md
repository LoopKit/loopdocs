## First Use of Actions Tab

Near the top middle of your <code>LoopWorkspace</code> &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">fork</span>&nbsp; is an <code>Actions</code> tab. This section provides detailed directions to enable <code>Actions</code>.

Click on the `Actions` tab of your <code>LoopWorkspace</code> repository.

* Your first time, a message appears saying `Workflows aren't being run on this forked repository` as shown in the graphic below
* Tap on the green button that says: `I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them`

    {align="center"}

The `workflows` are now displayed on the left side as shown in the graphic below. (Dismiss the `Actions Enabled` message using the `X` near the upper right side if it appears).

## Validate <code>Secrets</code>

??? abstract "Section Summary (click to open/close)"
    This step validates most of your six <code>Secrets</code> and provides error messages if it detects an issue with one or more.

    1. Click on the "Actions" tab of your LoopWorkspace repository and enable workflows if needed
    1. On the left side, select `1. Validate Secrets`.
    1. On the right side, click "Run Workflow", and tap the green `Run workflow` button.
    1. Wait, and within a minute or two you should see a green checkmark indicating the workflow succeeded.
    1. The workflow will check if the required <code>Secrets</code> are added and that they are correctly formatted. If errors are detected, please check the run log for details.

Near the top middle of your <code>LoopWorkspace</code> &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">fork</span>, click on the <code>Actions</code> tab.

* [<span class="loop-big">:material-skip-backward:</span>](#first-use-of-actions-tab)If you have never used <code>Actions</code> on this repository before, and need instructions (in addition to what *GitHub* shows), please back up to [First use of Actions Tab](#first-use-of-actions-tab).

Refer to the graphic below for the numbered steps:

1. Click on the `Actions` tab of your <code>LoopWorkspace</code> repository
1. On the left side, click on 1. <code>Validate Secrets</code>
1. On the right side, click `Run Workflow` to show a dropdown menu
    * You will see your default branch (typically this is `main`)
    * You can select a different branch, but typically, you run the default
1. Tap the green button that says `Run workflow`.

The `Validate Secrets` &nbsp;<span class=notranslate>Action</span>&nbsp; should succeed or fail in a few minutes. Do not continue to the next step until this one succeeds.

!!! tip "Hit Refresh"
    After you tap the green Run workflow button, *GitHub* can be slow to update.

    * Refresh the browser if you are unsure if the action started
    * Do not start a new action until the first one completes

* If you see the green check (:octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{: .passed })  continue to the next section
* If you see the red `X` (:octicons-x-circle-fill-16:{: .failed }):
    * Use the Browser Build Errors page to resolve the error, then repeat the Action

!!! tip "Pro Tip: Validate Secrets"
    The Action `Validate Secrets` is run every time you do any other action. Technically, you never have to run the action by itself - you could start with `Add Identifiers`.
    
    It is easier for you (or your mentors) to diagnose if there is a problem with the `Secrets` you entered when it is run stand-alone. Once your secrets are good, they should remain good, so this does not need to be repeated.

## <code>Add Identifiers</code>

!!! important "Browser Build Temporarily Unavailable for New Builders and Some Updating Builders"
    The Add Identifiers action does not work at this time.

    We are confident that the connection between *GitHub* Actions and *Apple* will be fixed. For now, please be patient.
