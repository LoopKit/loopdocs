# Step 8: Download Xcode

!!!danger "Time Estimate"
    * 45 minutes to 2 hours, depending on internet connection...but you don't need to babysit the download.

!!!info "Summary"
    * After making sure your Mojave is up-to-date, download Xcode from your computer's App Store application.

!!!warning "FAQs"
    * **"Why isn't my Xcode installing?"** I can't see your computer to know exactly why...but the two most common reasons are (1) lack of internet connection or (2) not enough free space on the computer's hard drive. Xcode is a pretty beefy sized download...and needs even a little more space to properly unpack itself and install. Best to try to have about 12-15GB of free space on your hard drive before starting to be on the safe side. If you get below 5GB of free space, I've seen installation failures around then. You can check your free space by clicking on the `About this Mac` (like in Step 1) and clicking the `Storage` tab.

Today is an easy one, but probably takes the longest of most of any of the days in terms of time...only because the download takes awhile. The good news is that you don't have to watch this. Instead, you can start the download and simply walk away for the rest of it.

Xcode is a free application for Apple computers. Xcode will turn the Loop "raw" code into an iOS application and install it onto your iPhone/iPod. **Make sure you have updated your macOS to Mojave AND checked the `Software Updates` button before proceeding...in other words, make sure you did Step 1's work.**

!!!danger "IMPORTANT UPDATE"
    Normally, you would obtain Xcode by simply downloading it from the App Store application on your computer. HOWEVER, we are going to need you to do something different for about the next week. Loop's dev code has been updated in preparation for iOS 13. In order for that new code to compile correctly, you will need to use Xcode 11 GM (golden master) version. This version of Xcode is not available in the App Store on your computer quite yet (should be available around Sept 19th). Therefore in the meantime, you will need to download Xcode 11 GM directly from your developer account. 
    
    1. Click on the "Account" link at the top right corner of <a href="https://developer.apple.com" target="_blank">the Apple Developer page</a> and login to your account.</br></br>
    
    2. Once you are logged in, you can click [here]( https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Developer_Tools/Xcode_11_GM_Seed/Xcode_11_GM_Seed.xip) to start the download of Xcode 11 GM seed...or navigate to the download link yourself (click on Downloads in left column of your developer console, then click on Applications icon, and then click on the link to the Xcode 11 GM seed download.)</br></br>
    
    3. Wait awhile as almost 8GB of download happens...</br></br>
    
    4. Double click the download to open it and follow the steps to finish installing Xcode 11 GM.</br></br>
