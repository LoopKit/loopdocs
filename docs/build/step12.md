# Step 12: Meet the Community

!!! info "Time Estimate"
    - Read about your [Social Media Options](../index.md#stay-in-the-loop): 5 minutes
    - Join one or more groups: 10 minutes

!!! abstract "Summary"
    - Learn how to use the search tools in Looped, Zulipchat, Loopdocs, and Looptips
    - Learn the motto "Help us help you".
    - Learn what information helps in solving a problem in building or in using Loop.
    - Avoid vague phrases and the word "it"; aim for details and specifics and use screenshots.

!!! question "FAQs"
    - **"I'm worried I'll ask a stupid question"** Don't worry. All the mentors started out as novices. Focus instead on asking a **thorough** question. A thorough question explains what you've already tried or read, has screenshots of what you are confused by, and any other details you can provide.

## Online Groups

There's a whole wonderful community of people already Looping who are willing to help you through the process. This link on [Social Media Options](../index.md#stay-in-the-loop) walks you through those groups and how to join.

The Loop help found at these sites is provided by volunteers. None of the people are paid to answer questions or spend time troubleshooting. They do it because they want to help others. Please decrease their support burden by doing some simple steps before turning to others for help. Please click the image below to watch this video full of tips to make the most of your online resources.

!!! info ""
    Please watch this video (just under 7 minutes) to learn about using announcements and searches in Facebook groups and the LoopDocs pages.

    Note, the LoopDocs menus were reorganized after this video was prepared.  The information on using LoopDocs starts on the home page and continues as you step through the build pages, which includes the gear information.

## Screenshots

Please take screenshots of your issue and use them in your posts. On an Apple computer, press `shift-command-4` keys at the same time and a little crosshairs tool will appear. Click-and-drag across the area you'd like to include in the screenshot. When you let go of the button, the screenshot will be saved to your desktop with a file name starting with the name "Screen Shot". To capture an entire window, press `shift-command-4` keys at the same time followed by pressing the space bar and then click on the window of interest.  Use screenshots instead of cell phone images whenever possible. Screenshots are higher resolution and easier to read.

Take a wider screenshot than you may initially think you need. Especially if you are asking for help with settings or Xcode build errors. Nightscout and Xcode have lots of valuable information off-to-the-side that many people dismiss, when it can be valuable for troubleshooters.

## Descriptive Language

Descriptive language doesn't mean the four-letter words that get you frowns at the cocktail parties. Instead, this phrase means to use the most accurate, detailed words you can when asking for help. In summary, try to avoid the word "it" and instead use details and information to help fill in the story about why you're asking for help, what you've already tried, and what happened when you tried those things (including screenshots). Let's illustrate with a couple of examples.

### Example 1

Loop users who have been around for several years will remember this bug - fortunately it got fixed a long time ago. Loop no longer allows you to enter your correction range in the wrong order, i.e., 110 to 90, which used to cause the behavior described in this example. The error was fixed quickly, but to get the fix, a rebuild was required.

**Bad:** "It's not working." <----makes me wonder what "it" is? What part of "it" isn't working exactly? The app? The BG control? The pump integration? Alarms? Bolusing? CGM?

**Ok:** "My Loop app won't open." <---- Ok, so now I know the Loop app itself seems to be the problem, but still don't know if this is a build error or an error that has happened after building. The solutions might be different.

**Better:** "My Loop app was working yesterday just fine, and now today it's not doing the things like I expect." <----- Getting closer. Now, I know this is not a build error and that it sounds like a more recent issue. I'm starting to narrow down the potential causes. This is about as much detail as it takes for me, as a volunteer, to consider helping. I might not have to ask 42 questions, but instead only 4 questions to find the remaining information for troubleshooting. If there were more details, it would save time.

**Awesome:** "My Loop app was working yesterday. Around lunch time, I went into the settings screen and made some adjustments and ever since it just turns white and closes no matter what I try." <---- DEFINITELY getting closer. Now I have a strong suspicion about where the bug is happening and can help with a couple links.

**GOLD MEDAL WORTHY:** "My Loop app was working yesterday. Around lunch time, I went into the settings screen and made some adjustments to correction ranges. Ever since I did that, the app immediately turns white and shuts down. I have tried restarting my phone, but it has not fixed the problem. I tried searching the docs for 'loop closing' but didn't see results that matched my issue." <----- This person is doing an outstanding job of describing the problem. Lots of good details. Has shown initiative to try to use the resources already. This person did an excellent job of helping all of us help him/her.

### Example 2

**Bad:** "My Loop app won't build." <----- What step are you on? What is the iOS on your phone? What kind of computer are you using? What macOS? What Xcode version? Have you built successfully before or is this new?

**Ok:** "I'm trying to update my Loop app to v2.2.6 and am getting a few errors that I don't understand." <----- Wow, sure would be nice to know what those error messages are. Are they red or yellow? A screenshot sure would help here.

**Awesome:** "I have a macOS Big Sur 11.5.3 computer with Xcode 12.5.1 and my phone is running iOS 14.7.1. Downloaded Loop-master (v2.2.6) this morning and I'm getting some red errors about an exit code that I don't understand. I've tried everything in the docs and nothing worked." <---- While I'm super happy they "tried everything", I'm no closer to knowing what the exact error message is nor which "stuff" exactly they tried. But all the version numbers are included.

**GOLD MEDAL WORTHY:** "I have a macOS Big Sur 11.5.3 computer with Xcode 12.5.1 and my phone is running iOS 14.7.1. Downloaded Loop-master (v2.2.6) this morning and I'm getting some red errors about an exit code 645 that I don't understand. Here's the screenshot of the error message. I tried searching the docs for "exit code 645" and didn't see any responses that helped. " <---- This is the kind of detail that will get you to an answer very fast.

## Be ok with links

Often, the best answer to your question for help will be answered with a link. Please don't take offense to getting a quick link back to LoopDocs or LoopTips. This is most often because the question is already answered there and the person is simply saving time by not typing out what already exists elsewhere.  There's a ton of information between these two sites, so it can be easy to overlook something if you're not sure what to search for. The mentors know if something is in the docs and they are experts at using the search tool to find the answer and drop the link as a quick response.

If you've searched the docs and read the info already, then please include that in your post or your reply. That way you don't get linked back to the same part you're already confused about. And if you have already read the specific section the mentor just linked, be specific about why your problem is not addressed by that link.  Or just say "I'm confused when the doc says this". Letting us know when these docs can be improved is very useful.
