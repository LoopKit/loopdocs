# Overview of Build Process

The overall build process is straightforward if you follow the step-by-step instructions.

The steps in the Build menu will help you through the following tasks:

* Check that you have or can obtain the compatible gear needed to Loop
* Prepare your computer
* Download the Loop code to your computer
* Build the Loop app on your phone

After the build, be sure to follow steps to [Set up](../operation/overview.md) and [Operate](../operation/features/carbs.md) the Loop app

This may appear intimidating at first, but it is quite doable by the average computer user.

To orient yourself, consider clicking through the Build Steps from Step 1 through Step 14 and read just the top three boxes on each page. If you're on a desktop, use `n` for next and `p` for previous.

* Time Estimate
* Summary
* FAQs

Once you've completed this quick overview of the build steps, return and read the pages completely for Steps 1 through 14. It's good idea to skim [Oh dear! Build errors?](build_errors.md) at this point. The most important take-away from that page is that most of the mistakes have already been made and there are correction steps to follow to get your build back on track. If that doesn't help, there are [mentors](../index.md#stay-in-the-loop) ready and willing to assist.

The next stage is to work through the steps and complete the tasks on each page.  You can do one a day or blaze through them all.  Just be sure to read carefully and if you are confused - reach out for help.

## Introduction to Loop Video

If you have never used Loop, click on the link to watch a short [Introduction to Loop Video](https://youtu.be/qw_u1lqboCs).

!!! warning "Old Video"
    * This video was created before the Omnipod version of Loop was released in April 2019 - so yes you can definitely use Omnipod Eros pumps
    * The menus have been rearranged slightly but the overall concept of how to use Loop is demonstrated in this video
    * The workout target shown in the video has been completely reworked as Overrides

!!! info "Take it one step at a time..."

    If you are worried about how long this will take, you can always stop at one of the steps and come back later. The steps are meant to be nice stopping points to take breaks if needed.
