# Overview of Build Process

The overall installation process is pretty simple. We start with checking that you have the compatible gear needed to Loop, do a couple of  preparation steps on the computer, and then move onto building the Loop app.

While all of this is probably quite intimidating at first, I promise that it is quite doable by the average computer user.

    If you are worried about how long this will take, you can always stop at one of the steps and come back later. The steps are meant to be nice stopping points to take breaks if needed.
