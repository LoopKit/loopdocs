# Building your Loop

Building your Loop app is actually quite easy.  The harder part will be having the patience to read all the documents you should before starting a closed loop.  New Loop users are so excited to get started that they skip reading all the great info that these docs contain.  So, as you begin the build...please include time to read the documents that follow what happens AFTER you successfully build your Loop app.

If you have any questions, these docs have a nice search feature that may help you find your answers pretty quickly too.
