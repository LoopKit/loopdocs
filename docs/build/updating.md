!!! faqs "FAQs"

    - **"What is an update?"** Anytime you want to change branches, add or change a customizations, or grab updates to the same branch you built before...that is an **update** of your Loop app.
    - **"Do I delete my old Loop app first?"** Definitely **not**! If you keep your Loop app on your phone, your Loop settings (and existing pod) will continue to work the same after the update. Seamless.
    - **"Do I need to start a new pod when I update?"** No. Your existing pod session will continue seamlessly if you are using the same Developer Account to sign the Loop app targets as you did the last time you built.
    - **"What if I'm using a new/different developer account?"** If you aren't building with the same developer account used when your existing app was built (this includes going from free to paid), then you will be installing a brand new (second) Loop app on your phone. Your existing pod won't work with the new app, so you might want to time this transition when you are due to change pods. Delete the old app once you get the new one all set up.
    - **"What if it is a new computer but the same developer account?"** No big deal...repeat Build Steps 1, 8 and 9 with your new computer.

## When to Update Loop

The apps built and signed by you in Xcode with a paid developer account will only last for 12 months before they expire and need rebuilding. So, at least once per year you will have to rebuild your app and go through this update process.

Under ordinary circumstances, you do not *have to* update your Loop app until you are ready to grab new features. However, we encourage regular updates when a new version is released because they often contain bug fixes or improvements which may increase operational stability. Also, if you have updated your phone iOS since the last build, you should download a new copy of the code.

## Step 1: Install macOS and Xcode updates

!!! warning "Verify macOS"

    Between Loop app builds, there's a high likelihood that Apple has updated one or more of the systems involved in your Loop app. If you don't have the minimum macOS, you cannot build on that phone.

    - For iOS 14.x, minimum is macOS 10.15.4 (Catalina)
    - For iOS 13.4 through 13.7, minimum is macOS 10.15.2 (Catalina)
    - For iOS 13.0 through 13.2, minimum is macOS 10.14.4 (Mojave)
    - For iOS 12.4, minimum is macOS 10.14.3 (Mojave)

!!! green "Verify Xcode"

    Now that you have updated your macOS, you should have the ability to see the most recent version of Xcode. The information for which Xcode is required is found in [Build Step 8](step8.md#how-do-all-the-minimum-versions-relate-to-each-other).  (It's not repeated because that way we only have to update it on one page.  In the time of rapid iOS changes, that's the best way to keep the information accurate.)

    If you see that you need to update (and you probably do), then keep following instruction on that page and the next one (Build Step 9) and then return to this page.

!!! info "Follow Build Step 9 after updating Xcode"

        Make sure to restart your computer after updating Xcode and follow the instructions in Build Step 9. There's a known issue that happens often enough to be frustrating if you skip those steps. Either a build error about missing simulators or a "device not connected" (even when phone is connected). It's not always required...but this is a good easy ounce of problem prevention.


If you think you are immune from needing to update and want to skip Step 1 on this page, at least review the compatibility chart in Build Step 8 to make sure your macOS and Xcode meet their minimums based on your device's iOS before proceeding.  Many people try to build without meeting the minimum versions - don't be that person.

## Step 2: Check your Developer Account

Apple updates its License Agreement for the Developer Program frequently. You need to login to your [developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account/) to manually check if there is a new agreeement to accept.  If you see a big red or orange banner across the top of your Developer Account announcing a new license agreement like shown below...please read and accept it before building Loop.

## Step 3: Download Updated Loop Code

After you've finished the updates to your devices listed above, you can move onto downloading updated Loop code. You will not be simply using your old downloaded Loop code (and in fact, you can delete those old folders now if you want).

If you aren't a developer or debugging, avoid the dev branch - and be warned once you install dev on a phone, you might have to completely delete the app to return to master or automatic-bolus.  

There is a fast and easy menu-driven script available to build Loop that works once you've updated your macOS and Xcode to versions compatible with your iPhone iOS.  It works for both master and automatic-bolus branches. The [Build Select Script](https://www.loopnlearn.org/build-select/) webpage has instructions on how to use the script. That script allows you to perform the rest of the steps on this page with a menu-driven interface. Before you head over there, finish reading this page so you understand all the steps that are needed. The steps are explained again over there, but not in quite so much detail.

If you prefer the zip download method, the links from Build Step 13 are repeated below. (These links always point to the most recent release of the code.) Click on one of the links below to download Loop code and then follow the manual steps on this page until you have a new version on your phone.

Both master and automatic-bolus are pretty stable and widely used.  The [Compare Version](https://www.loopnlearn.org/compare-branches/) webpage explains the differences between master and automatic-bolus.

- [Loop: master branch](https://github.com/LoopKit/Loop/archive/master.zip)

- [Loop: automatic-bolus branch](https://github.com/LoopKit/Loop/archive/automatic-bolus.zip)

## Step 4a: Delete old provisioning profiles

### Infrequent Builder, App Expires soon

If your app will expire soon or you build infrequently, then [Delete Profiles](updating.md#delete-profiles). Not sure when your app expires? Here are instructions to check your [Loop Expiration Date](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-expiration-date/).

### Frequent Builder

If you build frequently, you do not need to delete the profiles every time. There is a small chance that deleting the profiles will [force a new certificate](updating.md#revoke-certificate-issue) â€“ that will affect all apps built with your user ID.

### Background Information

Older versions of Xcode used to automatically create a new "provisioning profile" as part of the Loop building process. That provisioning profile, among other things, sets the expiration date for your app. If you sign with a paid team, that profile is set to expire in 12 months. If you sign with a free team, that profile is set to expire in 7 days.

You can always check the expiration date immediately after a successful build of your loop app by clicking the little "i" icon next the "Provisioning Profile" line in the target signing area. Add 12 months to the "created" date (paid account), or 7 days (free account), and you'll have your app's date of future spontaneous death, which you can record in your calendar.

![Screenshot: Xcode showing Provisioning Profile](img/provisioning-profile-date.png){width="850"}
{align="center"}

Here's what started happening about September 2019 with Xcode 11, the provisioning profiles were being reused so the date was not updated each time you built. This change resulted in many people's apps expiring unexpectedly (and therefore dying suddenly) starting in September 2020 despite having updated/rebuilt recently and having current developer accounts (either manually renewed or automatically renewed, doesn't matter).

Once you follow the steps in the orange box below, Xcode will have no memory of the old provisioning profiles and will be forced to create a brand new one with the next Loop build. Therefore, you'll get a brand spanking new "created" date that will match the build date.  Simple and straight-forward. (Leave Terminal app open to do Step 4b afterwards too.)

### Delete Profiles

!!! warning "How to delete old provisioning profiles"
    - Find your Terminal app (search in Applications)
    - Open your Terminal app
    - Copy and paste the line in the little grey box below into the Terminal prompt. Press enter after you paste it.

    `rm ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\ Profiles/*.mobileprovision`
    </br></br>You won't see anything special after you enter the command...your Terminal screen should look as boring as shown below when successful.

    ![Screenshot: terminal after provisioning profile deletion](img/empty-profiles.png){width="650"}
    {align="center"}

### Revoke Certificate Issue

What does it look like if you run into the force new certificate problem? When you prepare to Sign the Targets with Xcode, you'll see the message highlighted in the figure below.  

<br/>
![Screenshot: Xcode showing Revoke Certificate message](img/rejected-cert.svg){width="850"}
{align="center"}

More information is shown in the orange box below.

!!! warning "Revoke certificate"
    _"Your account already has an Apple Development signing certificate for this machine . . ."_

    You must revoke your certificate to continue - all apps built with this certificate stop working within 24 hours.

    Your Apple Developer ID is not affected so you can re-build on the existing Loop app on your phone and maintain all your settings with the new certificate



## Step 4b: Clean cache and derived data

This may not be necessary, but it is one of the first steps to try if you do get a build error. Since you already have Terminal app open, you can prevent one of the possible sources of build errors in advance by cleaning out straggler data from previous Loop builds.

!!! green "Clean cache and derived data"

    Using Terminal app that should still be open from Step 4a

    1. Copy and paste this command and press return: `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.carthage.CarthageKit` Note: you won't see any message back if the command runs successfully.</br></br>
    2. Copy and paste this command and press return: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData` Note: you won't see any message back if the command runs successfully.
    </br></br>You won't see anything special after you enter the commands...your Terminal screen should look as boring as it did in the previous step 4a.

    ![Screenshot: terminal after clean cache and derived data](img/cleaned-terminal.png){width="650"}
    {align="center"}

## Step 5: Build like normal

From here, go straight to [Step 14 Build Loop app](step14.md) and do just like you did the first time. Open the new Loop code that you just downloaded a couple steps above, plug in the phone, select your phone, sign four targets, code customizations (if wanted), and then build button. Easy peasy.

!!! info "Double check expiration date"

    If you want to make sure that step 4 above (deleting the provisioning profiles) went well, check the "created" date on your provisioning profile after you sign your Loop target for this rebuild. It should have the current date as the "created" date and your Loop app, if you successfully build, will function for 12 more months (for paid accounts) so long as you keep your developer account paid/automatically renewed.

    To find out expiration date later, use this [procedure](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-expiration-date/).


## Step 6: Resolve Build Errors if needed

!!! green "Check Build Errors Page"

    If you get a build error, check the [Build Errors page](build_errors.md). You might be able to resolve it yourself.

    Even if your exact error isn't there, the information you need to provide when asking for help is listed on that page. And that information is critical to allow mentors to help troubleshoot your build error.
