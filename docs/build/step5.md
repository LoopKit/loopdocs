## What is a RileyLink Compatible Device

The RileyLink compatible device is an open-source hardware device that can bridge Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to the radio-frequency wireless communication used by select Medtronic and Omnipod pumps. What does that mean to you? It means the device is the communication highway between your insulin pump, CGM, and iPhone.
