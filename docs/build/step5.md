# Step 5: Order a Radio-Link

!!! danger "Time Estimate"
    - 15-20 minutes to read about radio-link options
    - 15 minutes to order a radio-link

!!! info "Summary"
    - Decide what kind of radio-link to buy
    - Order your radio link

!!! warning "FAQs"
    - **RileyLink vs radio-link**: The RileyLink is the original design. It was the first and only radio-link for many years. Other DIY Loopers have created new versions, see [Radio-Link Options](step5.md#radio-link-options). You may see RileyLink in a lot of graphics and older documentation pages. The term radio-link is generic, whereas RileyLink, OrangeLink and EmaLink are specific to those versions.
    - **"Do I need a radio-link?"** Yes. DIY Loop will not work without a radio-link.
    - **"What happens if I lose my radio-link or walk away from it?"** Within a half hour, your pump returns to normal scheduled basal rate
    - **"Can I swap out radio-links at any time?"** Yes, you can. You do not need to start a new pod or rebuild Loop app. There's a place in Loop settings where you find your new device and turn "on" the Bluetooth connection within Loop to start using it. You can swap between RileyLink, OrangeLink, EmaLink or some future radio-link option.
    - **"How close does the radio-link need to be to me? Do I have to carry it with me?"** See [Radio-Link Range](step5.md#radio-link-range).


## What is a Radio-Link

The radio-link is an open-source hardware device that can bridge Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to the radio-frequency wireless communication used by select Medtronic and Omnipod pumps. What does that mean to you? It means the radio-link is the communication highway between your insulin pump, CGM, and iPhone.

**DIY Loop will not work without the radio-link.**

## Radio-Link Communications

All the radio-links communicate with the pump through radio frequency communications and with the phone through Bluetooth. Numerous factors can influence how well those communications can function...interferences from other devices, temperature, physical blocking, going through your body (think water), etc.

**Medtronic Only** When your radio-link and pump first connect, Loop performs a series of tests that you won't see...they are tuning tests. Basically, Loop sends little test messages via the radio-link to the pump and waits for a response. Loop tries this same "ping" to the pump over a range of frequencies based on the pump you've told Loop to expect (Medtronic NA/CA, or Medtronic WW). The Loop app will then use the radio frequency with the strongest response for future pump communications.

**For long-time Medtronic Loopers who remember hitting the tune button:** Usually this best frequency is constant for any given Medtronic pump + radio-link, but may drift with time or temperature changes. The tuning mentioned above is started automatically if pump communications fail for 14 minutes (in other words, two looping cycles). You no longer need to hit the tune button in the menu.

!!! info "Bluetooth (BT) Troubleshooting"

    If your iPhone has BT issues, your Loop will have failures. There have been reports of BT audio devices (such as BT pairings in your car or home audio BT speakers) interfering with the Loop. If you are finding Loop failures frequently happening at a particular location, you may try to troubleshoot if there are BT problems in the area.

Your BT signal strength can be seen in the Loop settings, Pump settings, Device menu, on the `Signal Strength` line. As you move closer and further away from your phone, you can watch that number dynamically change. This line is **not** displaying the signal strength of your pump RF communications, just BT between the radio-link and the phone.

You will notice the Signal Strength is a negative number and in units of dB. Remember that number line from elementary school?  A signal strength of -50&nbsp;dB is a stronger signal than  -80&nbsp;dB.<br/><br/>

## Radio-Link Range

The range at which radio-links will function is dependent on the environment that you are in. Both the OrangeLink and some sizes of the EmaLink have reported longer ranges than RileyLink, so they might be able to be kept in a more central location - but still need to be "near enough".

What influences this distance? The biggest influences are (1) body-blocking and (2) "noisy" environments. The human body is a lot of water, and water is an excellent blocker of wireless communication. So, sleeping on a pod and smothering it entirely with your body will possibly decrease the ability of radio-link to communicate with the pod. Environments with a high concentration of wireless signals can also interfere with radio-link communications and make closer proximity a benefit. Where might those kinds of situations happen? Concerts, conferences, and sporting arenas are pretty prone to interference.

Many people keep their radio-link on the same side of their body as their pump during the day. They use a pocket, carabiner, lanyard, SPIbelt - the options are endless. What you don't want to do is put the radio-link in a blocking bag that has RFID blocking (some travel fanny packs have that).  

The practical range can vary from type to type and among individual units. Do some experiments - send a communication signal from phone to pump - if it makes the round-trip, extend the distance and repeat the test.  Figure out what works for your devices.

Suggested communication signal to send for **Medtronic**: Button Press

Suggested communication signal to send for **Omnipod**: Read Pod Status

* If you have a newer version of Loop, the report from Read Pod status has the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) between the radio-link and the Pod
* The RSSI is a positive number with a larger number indicating a stronger signal strength detected by the Pod from the radio-link
* This information complements the BT signal strength reported in the device menu

If you want to be analytic about your range test, you can make a table of distance, Bluetooth strength and, if available, RSSI.

## Waiting for your Radio-Link

While you are waiting for the radio-link to arrive, you can proceed with finishing these build directions all the way through Step 14. After that you'll have to wait for the radio-link. You can't properly enter any settings or pump info in the Loop app without it.

The population of DIY loopers (Loop and Android APS) has grown enough that you might be able to find someone local to loan you their spare.

## RileyLink Extra Details

Since the RileyLink has been around the longest, some additional information about the RileyLink has been added to this page throughout the years. The rest of this page is specific just to the RileyLink.

### RileyLink Assembly

Your RileyLink will come with the Lithium-ion Polymer (LiPo) battery disconnected and the parts not already inside the case. It will be up to you to put the RileyLink in the case and attach the battery.

Make sure the LiPo battery is well-plugged into the connection. Line up the little ridge appropriately, and push fairly firmly to get the connection tight. Poor battery cable connection can make the Loop communications fail. See photos below, for example.

!!! warning "Common new user errors"

    The most common two errors for new RileyLink owners are (1) not fully pushing in the LiPo battery cable connection and (2) failing to charge the RileyLink. Compare your LiPo battery cable with the photos; it takes a bit of oomph to push that plug fully in like the photos shown below. Remember to charge your RileyLink each night.

![RileyLink showing Bad and Good battery insertion](img/battery-cables.jpg){width="400"}

Finally, the board and the battery fit into the slim case fairly tightly as well. Click on the image below to watch a helpful [assembly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GHxxEJMCZc&feature=youtu.be).

[![frame for video on how to insert RileyLink into slim case, follow link for video](img/slimcase.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GHxxEJMCZc&feature=youtu.be)

### RileyLink Lights

The RileyLink has several lights that you may notice from time to time. There is no 'power' light. If you suspect that your RileyLink is not being powered, try turning it off and on using the small sliding switch. You should see lights in the middle of the board flash when you do this. If they flash, that means the board has power.

* Red light: Charging light. The red light will remain on while RileyLink is charging, and it will turn off when charging is complete. You may notice the red light turn on periodically even after charging is complete...it's just "topping off".

* Green light: Bluetooth connection light. The green light will remain on while you have a BT connection with your iPhone. If that green light fails to stay on, you should troubleshoot your BT connections. Try restarting BT on your iPhone and/or turning the RileyLink off/on by its power switch.

* Blue light: Pump communications. If you have an older firmware on your RileyLink, some of the blue lights will flash periodically as it communicates with the pump. It's just letting you know that it is busy talking and collecting info. You will also see increased blue flashes if you have "Enabled Diagnostic LEDs" for Medtronic users that have the RileyLinks with updated firmware (shipping since late August 2018).

A solid blue light that consistently remains lit on the board could mean one of two things:

* A temporary issue that can be resolved by rebooting the RileyLink physically (turning the switch off/on), or

* An electrical short or damage to the board. Sweat and moisture are most likely culprits, so try to keep case free from those environments. Don't keep RileyLink in sports bras or waistband next to skin, for example, while exercising.

If your blue light remains on despite trying a restart, it is time to pull out your backup RileyLink.

### RileyLink Charging

The battery that comes with RileyLink is not charged completely when it is shipped, so be sure to charge it up before initial use. You'll need a [mini-USB cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-2-0-Cable--Male/dp/B00NH13S44) and [0.5A USB charging power supply](https://www.amazon.com/Cellet-Powered-Charger-iPhones-Smartphones-/dp/B00FE8WFCO) like your iPhone power supply. RileyLink takes about 2 hours to fully charge (the red light will turn off when fully charged, read note above about red light patterns) and should easily last at least a full day of constant Loop use. Typically, it can go into the 30-hour range without any problems. Most people charge their RileyLink each night when they are sleeping. You don't have to worry about leaving the RileyLink plugged in "too long" for charging. It will automatically stop charging the battery when it is fully charged.

Since the best practice is to charge your RileyLink overnight while you sleep, and the battery lasts safely over 24 hours, there is no battery level indicator for the RileyLink. The RileyLink's charge level is not viewable on Nightscout, nor within the Loop app. If you forget to charge your RileyLink overnight, you can recharge it with a portable USB battery in a pinch. A [short mini-USB cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/899) could be a good addition to a small gear bag.

### RileyLink Battery

Keep your RileyLink and its Lithium-ion Polymer (LiPo) battery protected from damage. LiPo batteries are unsafe when damaged or punctured, so the case is an important part of safe Looping. If your battery is damaged in some way, please disconnect it immediately, and dispose of it (they should be recycled). You can order new RileyLink batteries on the [GetRileyLink website](http://getrileylink.org/)

### RileyLink Battery Removal

To remove the LiPo battery from the RileyLink, please do so slowly and patiently. Work the battery connection side to side slowly to loosen it from the plug. Some people have reported success using small, curved needle-nose pliers such as hemostats. Others have used small flathead screwdrivers as shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/s2qNPLpfwww).
