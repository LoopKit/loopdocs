# Step 7: Install Homebrew

!!!danger "Time Estimate" _ 10-15 minutes assuming you know your computer's
password _ 35 minutes if you can't remember your password and have to guess

!!!info "Summary" \* Install Homebrew by simply copying and pasting a long line
of gibberish into the ugly Terminal application.

!!!warning "FAQs" \* **"What if I don't get an "Installation successful"
message?"** If you don't see a successful installation message, please try the
copy-paste again. If you fail to get Homebrew installed, your Loop build will
also fail. You can't just skip this step. The most common cause of errors is
failing to copy the ENTIRE line of code ...people sometimes fail to get that
last `"` at the end of the line. Also, you need to be using a user account on
the computer that has "admin" rights, since this process is installing a program
on the computer.

Breath deep...this step looks kind of "programmer code" weirdness. BUT, it
isn't. Well, it is...but we will be just simply copying and pasting one line of
the weirdness and then walking away. We don't actually have to know much about
Homebrew itself or what the line of code means exactly.

Homebrew is a program that will allow us to install the needed packages to build
Loop. Open the Terminal application on your computer. It is located in your
Applications folder and then look in the Utilities subfolder...the Terminal
application is in there like shown in the screenshot below.

The Terminal app is very plain looking when you open it. That is normal. Copy
and paste the line in the little grey box below into Terminal prompt.

`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Your screen should look like something like this after you copy it in...if it
does, then go ahead and press return to continue on with the installation
command.

</p>
</br>

There will be a prompt asking if you want to continue. Press return to continue,
then it will prompt for your password. <u>The password is your computer's
password.</u>

**<u><font color = "red">Don't freak out that you can't see your password while
you type. That is normal. The Terminal app doesn't show keystrokes when you
enter passwords, but it is still recording your password entry. If you think you
messed up because you were confused, press the delete key a bunch of times and
then start fresh with the password entry.</font></u>**

Wait while the script does its thing...you’ll see info scroll by and then it
will pause for a while. Eventually, it will be done and you’ll see something
that says “Installation successful” and you’ll have a ready Terminal prompt
again.</br></br>

You can close the Terminal application now. You’re done with it. You do not need
to do these steps again for any subsequent Loop builds. This is one of those
"just do it once" installations. If you get a new computer though, you will have
to repeat this step for the new computer.
