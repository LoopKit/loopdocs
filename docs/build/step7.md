# Step 7: Skip Step 7

In the olden days, Loop could only be built on a computer using another tool called carthage that could only be installed with another tool called homebrew.

No longer needed.  In Jan 2021, when the version of carthage advanced from 0.36.0 to 0.36.1; Loop-building came to a halt. The developers responded and now you don't need to install carthage. That means you can skip this page.

If you have previously built, so have previously done this step check [Build Errors: Carthage](build_errors.md#carthage-error).
