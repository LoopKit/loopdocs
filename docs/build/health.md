# Health Data

Loop app uses the iPhone's Health app to store blood glucose, insulin, and carbohydrate data. Additional details about how to use Health to interpret your longer-term looping data can be found [here in LoopTips](https://kdisimone.github.io/looptips/data/health/). Health data can also be accessed and uploaded by Tidepool's Mobile app and is an important step in Jaeb Observational Study enrollment. Please review the settings below to ensure you have the proper settings.

## Loop Permissions

<table>
<th><img src="../img/healthapp.jpg" width="100%"></th>
<td>When you first finish building your Loop app, you need to set up Loop's permissions to store data in Health.</br></br>When this screen appears, you should toggle on all of the categories for Loop for both reading and writing, so that the green sliders are showing. If you didn't turn those on, you should go back and set the permissions directly in Health app.</br></br>It is important at this point to also consider other apps which you may have previously given Health permissions to. In particular, <b><u>you do not want other apps, like myFitness Pal or Spike app, writing carbohydrate data to Loop</u></b>. This can cause Loop to have "doubled" carb entries and you will get incorrect insulin deliveries related to doubled carb entries. You can check your various apps' permissions by clicking on the sources button at the bottom of the Health app. Click on the apps listed as a source, and make sure none of them have permission to write carbohydrates to Health.</td>

## Dexcom Permissions

You also need to enable your Dexcom app to write to the Health app. You can find this in your Dexcom app's Settings, under Health.  Click on the `Enable` button and then `Turn All Categories On` so that the toggle for allowing Dexcom to write data is now a green color.
