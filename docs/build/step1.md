# Step 1: Compatible Computer

!!! danger "Time Estimate"
    - 5 minutes, if you already have a Mac with Big Sur macOS
    - 30-60 minutes, if you need to install macOS updates

!!! info "Summary"
    The [minimum macOS](step1.md#macos) required depends on your phone iOS. If you are procuring a Mac, you'll want to have Big Sur as the operating system.

    - The newest macOS 11.x (Big Sur) will be required for iOS 14.5 (coming soon)
    - The previous macOS 10.15.x (Catalina) works up through iOS 14.4.x
    - The next oldest macOS 10.14.x (Mojave) only works for phones with iOS 13.2 or earlier
    - If your macOS does not meet the minimum, check to see if you can [update your macOS](step1.md#check-your-macos)
    - If you cannot update your existing computer, you'll need to check into a borrowed computer, patcher tool, or perhaps a new/used computer.

!!! warning "FAQs"
    - **"Can I use a PC or Windows computer? I don't own an Apple computer."** Please read this FAQ about using a [Virtual Machine](../faqs/FAQs.md#can-i-use-a-pc-or-windows-computer-to-build).
    - **"Can I borrow someone else's Apple computer?"** Please see this FAQ about [Borrowing a Computer](../faqs/FAQs.md#do-i-need-to-own-my-own-apple-computer).
    - **"How often do I need to use the computer?"** Computer access is required when you are initially installing the Loop app or updating to a newer Loop release. You do NOT need access to an Apple computer to update your phone iOS or to troubleshoot or change Loop settings, such as basal profiles or carb ratios.

## New M1 Chip Apple Computers

The newest Apple computers, released in November 2020, are compatible with Loop building. These new computers will make Loop building extremely fast.

## MacOS

The minimum macOS depends on the iOS of your iPhone/iPod. The latest macOS, Big Sur (11.x) can be used to build Loop for any of the phone iOS versions listed below and may be **required** to build on any iPhone with an iOS version starting with iOS 14.5. The Mojave macOS can not be used if your phone is updated past iOS 13.2.

* **If you have iOS 14.5 (not yet out) or newer**, the minimum macOS is expected to be Big Sur (11.x)

* **If you have iOS 14 to 14.4.x**, the minimum macOS is 10.15.**4** (Catalina), newer is ok (Catalina or Big Sur)

* **If you have iOS 13.4 to 13.7**, the minimum macOS is 10.15.2 (Catalina), newer is ok (Catalina or Big Sur)

* **If you have iOS 12.4 to 13.2**, the minimum macOS is 10.14.4 (Mojave), newer is ok (Catalina or Big Sur)


!!! danger "iOS Dictates Your Computer Needs"

    Put simply for Loopers...the more up-to-date you keep your phone iOS, the more up-to-date your computer and macOS will need to be to enable a fresh build of Loop. A new build is required at least once a year. You can't avoid iOS updates forever...you just need to be aware of how they relate to each other if your computer is "getting on the older side". There will be more information presented on iOS in [Build Step 8: Download Xcode](step8.md#download-xcode).

Do not use any of the beta macOS versions. (If you don't know what that means, don't worry...that means you aren't using one.)

## Check Your macOS

You need an Apple computer that has at least the minimum macOS version described above. To find out which version you have installed, click on the little Apple icon in your computer's upper left corner and select `About this Mac`. It doesn't matter if the computer is a MacBook, iMac, macMini, etc...just so long as it has the minimum macOS you'll need.

If your computer does not have the required minimum macOS version, you'll need to check the `Software Update` button on that screen to see if you can update.

If your computer does not give you the option to update to a newer macOS (in other words you are stuck on older versions)...it is quite possible that Apple no longer provides updates for your computer. How old is too old? That will depend on your computer model and year as shown below:

## Check the Space Available

While you are on the screen, above, look at the top of the menu and click on the Storage Tab.  You will need to know the amount of free space when it's time for [Build Step 8: Download Xcode](step8.md)
