# Step 1: Compatible Computer

!!!danger "Time Estimate" _ 5 minutes, if already have Mojave macOS _ 30-60
minutes, if need to install macOS updates

!!!info "Summary" _ Check your macOS and make sure it is Mojave. _ Do not use
any of the beta macOS versions. (If you don't know what that means, don't
worry...that means you aren't using one.) _ If your macOS is not Mojave, check
to see if you can up update your macOS to Mojave and do so. _ If you cannot
upgrade your existing computer to Mojave, you'll need to check into a borrowed
computer, patcher tool, or perhaps a new/used computer compatible with
Mojave. \* Check the `Software Update` to see if your Mojave version has any
updates available since you first installed it.

!!!warning "FAQs" _ **"Can I use a PC or Windows computer? I don't own an Apple
computer."** Yes...sort of. Please see
[this FAQ about using Virtual Machine](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/FAQs/#can-i-use-a-pc-or-windows-computer-to-build).
_ **"What can I do if my computer is too old to be upgraded to Mojave?"** You
could take a look at using [Mojave Patcher](http://dosdude1.com/mojave/), but
this is totally on your own and not part of these instructions. Just offering
the answer to the FAQ...it is up to you to read about the patcher tool and what
risks it may involve for you. _ **"Can I borrow someone else's Apple
computer?"** Yes, please see
[this FAQ about borrowing a computer](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/FAQs/#do-i-need-to-own-my-own-apple-computer)
to learn more. _ **"How often do I need to use the computer?"** Computer access
is only required when you are initially installing the Loop app or updating to a
newer Loop release. You do NOT need access to an Apple computer in order to
troubleshoot or change Loop settings, such as basal profiles or carb ratios.

## Check your macOS

You need an Apple computer that has at least macOS 10.14.3 (or newer) installed.
This macOS is called Mojave. To find out if you have Mojave installed, click on
the little Apple icon in your computer's upper left corner and select the
`About this Mac`. It doesn't matter if the computer is a MacBook, iMac, macMini,
etc...just so long as it has macOS Mojave. If your computer does not have
Mojave, you'll need to check the `Software Update` button on that screen to see
if you can update to Mojave.

If your computer does not give you the option to upgrade to Mojave...it is quite
possible that Apple has decided your computer is too old to run Mojave. How old
is too old? That will depend on your computer model and year as shown below:
