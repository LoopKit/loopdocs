    - **What is a RileyLink Compatible Device?** RileyLink refers to both the communication protocol and the name of the original device. Other DIY Loopers have created [RileyLink Compatible Devices](rileylink.md#rileylink-compatible-devices) that use the RileyLink protocol. All these devices can be used interchangeably with the *Loop* app to support Eros and Medtronic use.
    - **Do I have to buy one?** These are open-source hardware devices, but it takes special skills to build them yourself. It is recommended you buy one (or two) if you require it. At the current time, new OrangeLink and EmaLink devices are available for purchase. There are many used devices available in the community now that many users have switched to DASH. **Not needed for DASH**

## What is a RileyLink Compatible Device

The RileyLink compatible device is required to allow your phone to talk to compatible *Medtronic* and *Omnipod Eros* pumps. **It is not needed for *Omnipod DASH* pumps.**

!!! abstract "Details for RileyLink"
    The RileyLink compatible device is an open-source hardware device that can bridge Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to the radio-frequency wireless communication used by compatible *Medtronic* and *Omnipod Eros* pumps.

Loop 3 has *Omnipod DASH* support, among other new features. When using *Omnipod DASH*, the RileyLink compatible device is not necessary.  If you are using *Medtronic* or *Omnipod Eros* (not DASH), you still need the device regardless of which version of Loop you are running.

*Medtronic* and *Omnipod Eros* pumps require a RileyLink compatible device.

## RileyLink Compatible Devices

The RileyLink protocol defines a specific Bluetooth interface and way of opening a Sub-GHz radio channel to pumps. All RileyLink compatible devices follow the RileyLink protocol.

There used to be just one option, the original RileyLink. Now there are more options, so you have to make a decision. Depending on your choice, be sure to have the correct charger and cables or batteries handy and add spare compatible supplies to your diabetes go-bag.
