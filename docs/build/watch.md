If you add an Apple Watch after building Loop, you will need to pair your watch to your iPhone and then rebuild Loop to enable the Loop watch app to show up as an available watch app.

Loop is currently supported with all released versions of the Apple Watch and Apple Watch OS3.  Cool factor is increased since the Loop user can directly enter carbs and boluses straight from the watch, without needing to access the iPhone.

The carb and bolus screen on the watch can be accessed by force touching the watch (hard press).   A loop complication exists to show BG on the watchface but the update rate is limited to ~30mins due to limitations imposed by apple to increase battery life. If constant, real-time monitoring is desired, you should use the Loop app as the main screen. This can be achieved by setting the watch to always show last opened app on wake. Loop will always have to be the last app opened for this to work.
