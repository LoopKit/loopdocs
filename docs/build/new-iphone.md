# New iPhone

If you get a new iPhone, the Loop app will need to be rebuilt onto the iPhone.
Loop will not restore onto the new phone from a saved backup.

To install Loop onto the new iPhone just take a few simple steps.

1. Pair your new iPhone with your existing Apple Watch before rebuilding Loop
   onto the new iPhone.</br>

2. Follow the directions in the
   [Updating Loop page](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/build/update/updating/).
   The only difference in steps for installing on a new iPhone vs. updating on
   an old iPhone is that you will be prompted to `Register Device` in the
   signing targets area because the new iPhone needs to be registered with your
   developer account. Easy, single button press in Xcode's target area will
   complete the registration.</br>

3. You will need to input your Loop settings and configurations from scratch in
   the new iPhone.</br>

4. You will need to slide the RileyLink slider "off" in the old iPhone in order
   for it to pair with the new iPhone's Loop app.

If you are a Omnipod user...yes, a new phone will mean a new pod will be
required when you switch devices. Plan accordingly to time your switch when it
is also convenient to change pods.
