# Step 9: Xcode Preferences

!!!danger "Time Estimate"
    - about 10-15 minutes to install the Command Line Tools
    - 5 minutes to add your Apple ID, assuming you remember your password

!!!info "Summary"
    - Open Xcode Preferences and add your Apple ID under the Accounts tab.
    - Verify that Command Line Tools has been properly installed under Xcode Preferences under the Locations tab.

!!!warning "FAQs"
    - **"I still only see an account with `(personal team)` beside it even though I enrolled in the paid Developer Account program...what should I do?"** You should check your spam email box in case Apple sent you an email there. Make sure you've waited the 48 hours that Apple says it may take to get your account approved. If it's been 48 hours and you still don't see anything in your email, contact Apple support and ask them about the status of your enrollment. It may be held up by something on their end.

Since you've been working in order, you will now have Xcode installed on your computer from Step 8. You will also have enrolled in the Apple Developer program with a paid account, if that was your selection, in Step 6. Now we need to tell Xcode about your Developer Account.

Open Xcode from your Applications folder.

## Command Line Tools

There may be a short delay the very first time you open Xcode because it will install a package of tools. Don't close that window out, let it finish...we will need those Command Line Tools. Helpful tip: When the Command Line Tools installation is done and the pop-up window closes, check that your Command Line Tools installed correctly. Open Xcode's Preferences by clicking on the word **`Xcode`** in the top menu bar (just to the right of the Apple icon in the upper-left corner) and selecting `Preferences` in the drop-down menu. The keyboard shortcut to open Xcode Preferences is `command-comma` if that's easier for you. Then select the `Locations` tab of Preferences window and you'll see the dropdown menu for Command Line Tools. Make sure that Xcode 12.0.1 (or newer) is selected there.

## Add Apple ID

Go to the Xcode Preferences window from above, click on the `Accounts` tab and then press the `+` in the lower-left corner to add an Apple ID account.

If you want to use a free developer account, you will simply enter your Apple ID in this section and Xcode will automatically enroll your Apple ID in the free developer program. If you enrolled in the paid account already and have confirmation that your account is active, enter the Apple ID of the paid developer account. The screenshot below shows the labeling of team names based on whether from free account vs. paid account. Free teams will have `(personal team)` after the name.

You are now done setting up Xcode.  Great job!  You will not need to redo the account setup steps on any subsequent builds or updates of your Loop app.  Xcode will remember these settings.
