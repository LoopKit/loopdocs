## Services for the *Loop* App

Near the bottom of your *Loop* settings screen is a section called "Services".

!!! question "Sevices are Optional"
    * The *Loop* app will work whether you use these or not.
    * *Nightscout* is highly recommended, but can be added later - you don't need it to get started.

The services are added by tapping on the &plus; sign and choosing the service from the list. Services are shown alphabetically. The most common services are [*Nightscout*](#nightscout) and [Tidepool](#tidepool).

## *Nightscout*

There is a whole section in *LoopDocs* about *Nightscout*. For more information, see [*Nightscout* Overview](../nightscout/overview.md){: target="_blank" }. That also has the links you might need to the official [*Nightscout* Documentation](https://nightscout.github.io/) (different website).

If you have an existing *Nightscout* site, it's still a good idea to review that section, but here's the quick summary of how to add your Site URL and API_SECRET to have your Loop data transmitted to your *Nightscout* site. If you canâ€™t remember your API_SECRET, it can be found under Settings, Reveal Config Vars for Heroku sites (or Application Settings, Connection Strings for Azure sites).

### *Nightscout* Login

The graphic below shows the steps needed to add your *Nightscout* site to the *Loop* app. See the tip below about using stored passwords on the phone. If you have your credentials stored in passwords, simply tap the URL row to show the password option and select it.

1. While in the *Loop* app, tap on the Settings icon, scroll down to Services and tap the Add Service Row
2. Choose Nightscout Service
3. Tap on the URL row
    * If your credentials are not saved in your Passwords, enter the URL including https:// in this row
4. This step has two options:
    * If your credentials are saved in Passwords, tap on the Passwords icon and select them
    * Both the URL and API_SECRET will be filled in from your Passwords
    * Otherwise, manually fill in the API_SECRET row
5. Tap on Login to add this site

The *Loop* app will begin uploading your data from this point on - it does not back-fill old data to the Nightscout site.

However, if there is a temporary outage of internet service or if the *Nightscout* site stops working temporarily, the *Loop* app will fill in all data not uploaded during the outage up to a total of 7 days worth of data.

The two most common errors in filling out this section are:

1. Failure to use `https://`  in the site URL.  If you use `http://` (see how that doesn't have the "s" at the end?), you will get an error message about an App Transport Security policy.
2. Having a trailing slash on the end of the URL (or an embedded space). If you copy and paste from a web browser, make sure to delete the trailing slash on the URL entry.

!!! warning "Do not block your *Nightscout* site"
    * One family had an app configured to block some websites for their child's phone and accidentally blocked their *Nightscout* URL - took them a while to figure out that mistake.

!!! tip "Add a Password"
    To make it easy to access your Nightscout URL and API_SECRET, add a password to your iPhone:

    1. The first step depends on iOS Version:
        * For iOS 17 and earlier, use iOS Settings, Passwords
        * For iOS 18 and newer, use the *Apple* [Password app](https://support.apple.com/en-us/104955)
    1. Tap + to add
        * Enter a name, e.g., "Nightscout" in the Title row
        * Enter the URL without the "https://" in the Website row
        * Enter the URL including the "https://" in the User Name row
        * Enter the API_SECRET in the password row
    1. If you use tokens, you can add those in the Notes section - they will be hidden behind the authentication for the passwords

### *Nightscout* Logout

If you want to stop uploading to a given *Nightscout* site or change to a different *Nightscout* site, you must first logout. You can then login again at the new site.

The graphic below indicates how to remove your *Nightscout* site from the *Loop* app. This will stop future uploads from the *Loop* app to that site.

## *Tidepool*

Data can be directly uploaded from *Loop* to *Tidepool* by adding it as a Service.

Please refer to the [LoopTips: Data: *Tidepool*](https://loopkit.github.io/looptips/data/tidepool/) page for more information about *Tidepool*.

When you add the *Tidepool* Service to *Loop*, be sure to disable *Tidepool* Mobile ability to read from Apple Health.

!!! warning "Double entries"
    If you have *Tidepool* Mobile installed on your phone, with the Connect to Health feature enabled, while also using the *Tidepool* Service in *Loop*, all of your carb and insulin records will be doubled on the *Tidepool* Web browser display.

    Even when you turn off the access to Health on the *Tidepool* Mobile app when you turn on *Loop* *Tidepool* service, you will still get 7 days of overlap because *Loop* stores 7 days of data.

    There is a filter button on the *Tidepool* Website you can use to separate the two data sources.

You can still use the note taking feature with *Tidepool* Mobile when Health is not connected, although you must have internet connectivity for this to work.

*Tidepool* Support is available to help troubleshoot issues or answer questions about using *Tidepool*. Contact them via email at support@tidepool.org.

## Amplitude

[Amplitude](https://amplitude.com) is a remote event monitoring service and can be used to quickly identify errors and events with *Loop*. Amplitude stores the events and allows you to view those events as points in time. To retrieve the details of the events you will need to look at corresponding mLab data entries to get a complete picture of the issues. If you sign up for a free account with Amplitude, you will be given an API Key that you can enter here to have *Loop* integration setup.
