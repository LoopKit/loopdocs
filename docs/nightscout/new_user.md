!!! info "Is Nightscout Required for Loop?"

    Nightscout is not required, but is recommended for Loop.

    - A Nightscout site provides a dashboard for remote viewing of Loop actions including the temporary basal rates Loop is setting, the current insulin on board, or a recent bolus and carb entry
    - A Nightscout site provides reports for retrospective review of your settings
    - You will want a Nightscout site:
        - If you are a parent of a little Loop user
        - If you want to see Loop's actions anywhere other than the Looper's iPhone
        - If you want to ask a mentor for help adjusting your settings


### Setup Nightscout

Please visit [The Nightscout site](https://nightscout.github.io) to read the introductory material and then proceed to the Installation page for directions on how to set up your new Nightscout website.

### Add Loop Variables to Nightscout

There are a few Loop-specific variables you should configure to get the most out of your Nigghtscout site. Follow the [instructions to retrofit an existing Nightscout site](update_user.md#step-2-editadd-config-vars).

## Add Nightscout to Loop

Once you finish setting up your new Nightscout site, don't forget to [enter the website into your Loop settings](../operation/loop-settings/services.md#nightscout)! This way Loop will have access to your Nightscout site to upload all the wonderful data.

## Troubleshooting

If your Nightscout site is not showing CGM (and Loop, if you are Looping) data within about 10 minutes of finishing your setup, then please follow these steps [here](troublehoot.md) to troubleshoot.
