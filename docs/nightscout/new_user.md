# New Nightscout Users

Two options exist for easy hosting of NS; Azure or Heroku. Both hosting services are free.  However,  Azure has data quotas monthly and shorter term CPU quotas.  If you exceed those quotas, you may be facing a monthly data-use bill or being locked out of NS for about 12 hours until the quotas reset.  As you start to use NS more intensively for alarms, pebble watches, etc…it is possible that you may exceed your monthly data cap on Azure.  Many Loop users have transitioned their old sites from Azure over to Heroku and have found the hosting change to be beneficial.  Heroku also has some memory limits, but those limits have been more than adequate for Loop users.  Therefore, we recommend new users start with Heroku.

## HEROKU NIGHTSCOUT SET-UP

* Create an account at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and choose the Primary Development Language to be Node.js when you create your account.  You’re going to use a free account, but you will still need to enter credit card information for your account setup.  Don’t forget to check your email to confirm your Heroku account.

* Go to the [Nightscout cgm-remote-monitor repository](https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor)

* Click the `Fork` button in the upper right corner

</p> 

* Give your app a name, this will be the prefix of your NS site’s URL. For example, `https://yourappname.herokuapp.com`

* Fill out the information lines in the `Config Variables` Section of that page, as shown below.  Some of the lines can stay with the default entries already provided.

* Click the purple `Deploy` button at the bottom of screen

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/deploy_button.jpg" width="450">
</p> 

* Wait a little bit while Heroku builds your NS app.  You’ll see some text scroll by in the Build App box, and then finally, you will have a message that the NS app was successfully deployed.

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/deploy_success.jpg" width="450">
</p> 

* You can verify your site’s successful build by clicking `View` (you should see black site with a profile warning).  You will be redirected to a profile set-up page.  (If it doesn't redirect automatically, refresh your webpage).  

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/no_profile.jpg" width="450">
</p> 

You do not have to enter all the information in the profile if you are using Loop (since Loop will be providing the information for IOB and COB rather than letting NS calculate them), but you do have to fill out the `Basal Profile` and `TimeZone` at a minimum in order to have your temp basals properly display.  Click `Save` when you have entered the information.  You will be prompted to authenticate, if it is the first time you’ve used the device to make changes in your profile.  Click on the `Authenticate` link at the bottom of the site, and enter your API_SECRET to complete the authentication.

* Assuming your previous browser tab is still open for "Create a new App | Heroku", let's go back to that tab.  This time instead of choosing the `View` option, we are going to select the `Manage App` button. Then, select the `Settings` tab near the top of the screen on your Heroku app.

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/settings_heroku.jpg" width="450">
</p> 

* Click on `Reveal Config  Vars`. Scroll down the bottom of the Config Vars lines until you find the last blank one.  You are going to add several additional lines of config vars for Loop use; the DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED is a required line, the others just make Nightscout more useful when Looping.

* Click on `Open App` in the top right corner of your Heroku site.

</p> 


* Click on the settings (those three horizontal lines in upper right corner).  Now check that your basal render is selected to either default or icicle (personal preference for how the temp basals show as blue lines in NS site), check the boxes that you’d like display pills in the SHOW PLUGINS (usually all of them), and then press save. Your NIGHTSCOUT site is all set-up.  Congrats!

## EVENT HISTORY

Don't forget to keep you Loop App's Preferred Source set to `Event History` if you want your NS site to smoothly integrate.  Preferred Source set to `Reservoir` will result in carbs not being uploaded and temp basals not being displayed.
