# Reports

Nightscout offers some fantastic data-crunching report tools.

Note - different sets of documentation call the three horizontal lines in the upper right of the Nightscout display different things such as:

* Settings
* Hamburger Menu
* Drawer Menu

Regardless of its name, it takes you to other sections of Nightscout well worth exploring.

The [Nightscout Documentation for Reports](https://nightscout.github.io/nightscout/reports/) has been expanded and updated.  

Therefore it has been removed from LoopDocs to prevent duplication and inconsistency, with the link provided to assist the user.
