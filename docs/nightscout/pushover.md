# Remote Notifications

While Loop app currently sends notifications locally on Loop user's iPhone, parents and caregivers likely want those messages on their phones, too.  We can achieve this functionality through a combination of Nightscout (NS), IFTTT, Google, and Pushover.

The page on Remote Notifications that used to be in LoopDocs has been moved to the [NS Remote Notifications](https://nightscout.github.io/nightscout/pushover/) documentation and removed from LoopDocs to prevent duplication and inconsistency.

* Warning: As of Sep 2021, this page in not in the NS menu structure (you must search to find it) but the NS documentation administrators are aware of the problem.

Please use the [Nightscout Documentation](https://nightscout.github.io/) site and their Search feature.
