# IFTTT Integration

If This, Then That (IFTTT) is a useful Nightscout (NS) integration.  

The page on IFTTT that used to be in LoopDocs has been moved to the [NS IFTTT](https://nightscout.github.io/nightscout/ifttt/) documentation and removed from LoopDocs to prevent duplication and inconsistency.

* Warning: As of Sep 2021, this page in not in the NS menu structure (you must search to find it) and the NS version has not been updated (method to get API Secret hash is incorrect) but the NS documentation administrators are aware of the problem.

Please use the [Nightscout Documentation](https://nightscout.github.io/) site and their Search feature.
