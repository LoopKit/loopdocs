## Nightscout Documentation

A number of pages that used to be in LoopDocs have been moved to the Nightscout documentation and are in the process of being integrated into their menu structure. To prevent duplication and inconsistency, those pages have been removed from LoopDocs.  A cross-reference to the Nightscout pages is provided below.

* Warning: As of Sep 2021, some of the pages moved from LoopDocs to Nightscout documentation are not yet in the Nightscout menu structure
* You can always use the search function of [Nightscout: Documentation](https://nightscout.github.io/) to find any topic


## IFTTT Integration

If This, Then That (IFTTT) integration is a useful Nightscout capability. By using IFTTT, you can have single button presses on your iPhone that will set an override, log a cannula change, log a sensor change and much more.

## Remote Notifications

While the Loop app sends notifications locally on the Loop user's iPhone, parents and caregivers may want those messages on their phones, too.  We can achieve this functionality through a combination of Nightscout, IFTTT, Google, and Pushover.

* Please see
      * [Nightscout: Configurations: Pushover](https://nightscout.github.io/nightscout/setup_variables/#pushover)

### Loop Follow

Loop Follow was created by Jon Fawcett who took ideas from multiple other apps to create a single app to assist in his caregiving role. It is popular with Loopers who like the display and notifications as well as Loop caregivers. It can work with just the Dexcom Share credentials and/or the Nightscout URL and allows for easy customization of alerts and alarms.

## Pebble Watch

LoopDocs had a page specifically about the Pebble Watchface called `SkyLoop Predict`, which is no longer being supported. The Nightscout Documentation provides information about many methods for displaying your Nightscout data on a variety of wearable devices.
