# Omnipod Users

Your Loop won’t have much showing initially until we get some basic settings input. The beginning step will be to add a pump to your Loop. If you are using an Omnipod pump, you can follow along for the rest of this page. If, however, you are using a Medtronic pump, please head over to [this page](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/operation/loop-settings/mdt-pump/) instead.

## Select Pump Type

Let’s start by clicking on the Loop Settings button in the tool bar at the bottom of your Loop app. It looks like a little sprocket. On the settings screen that opens, click on `Add Pump` and select the **Omnipod** option that appears.

## Select RileyLink

A list of all RileyLinks in the nearby area will display in the RileyLink Setup screen. Select your RileyLink by sliding the toggle to display green and then press the blue `Continue` button at the bottom of screen. If your RileyLink does not appear, make sure that its switch is turned on (switch slide up toward the case's keyring) and lipo is charged.

## Delivery Limits and Basals

The next screen will offer two areas where you will need to enter information:

* Delivery Limits: Delivery Limits are both your maximum basal rate and your maximum bolus amount. Your maximum basal rate will limit how aggressive your Loop will be able to set temporary basals to treat high blood glucose. Typically, new users should set this value conservatively around 3 times your highest scheduled basal rate until your comfort and experience with Loop develops.

* Basal Rates: Enter your scheduled basal rates, beginning at midnight. Consistent with pod use, the scheduled basal rates have a maximum of 24 entries, no 0 u/hr entries allows, and rate increments of 0.05 u/hr.

When you finish entering in these values, press the blue `Continue` button on the bottom of the Pod Settings screen to continue with the next steps of pod setup.

## Pair Pod

1. Place pod near RileyLink
2. Fill pod with insulin until pod beeps (minimum fill is 80 units)
3. Click the `Pair` button
4. Wait while the progress bar for priming completes
5. Press the `Continue` button when the blue checkmark confirms priming is complete

## Insert Cannula

1. Prepare your insertion site
2. Remove the pod's needle cap and adhesive backing
3. If cannula is safely tucked away, apply pod to your desired infusion site. If cannula is sticking out, press `cancel` in the upper right corner of screen and try a new pod.
4. Listen to the clicks filling the canula, wait for insertion and the progress bar to complete. The number of clicks to insertion is not consistent. The cannula will deploy before the progress bar is completed.
5. Confirm cannula has deployed by looking through the peep hole on pod
6. Press the `Continue` button
7. Setup is complete and your pod is ready for use when you press the final `Continue` button

## Expiration Reminder

Finish the setup with using the default expiration reminder time (2 hours before a full 3-days usage) or set the expiration notification to a more convenient time to your liking which will show up in your locked screen and vibrates at that time.

## Pod Settings

After pod pairing is completed, you will be on the Pod Settings screen. This screen will provide a variety of important information about your pod. You can always come back to this screen later by tapping on the Omnipod image in your Loop settings.

</p></br>

####  Device Information
The first section has information regarding how long the pod has been active, expiration date and time, pod indentifying information (if you have to call in for a pod failure).

#### Pod commands
There are two commands that you can issue through Loop to the pod. 

* Suspend Delivery: This command will suspend all insulin delivery; basals, temp basals, and boluses in progress. When you press suspend delivery, all insulin delivery will stop indefinitely. A banner notice will appear on the Loop's main screen when insulin delivery is suspended. You will need to press the `Resume Delivery` button to resume your scheduled basal rate and let Loop get back to action. Bolus deliveries will not be resumed, if they were interrupted.

* Replace Pod: This command should be used to deactivate a pod prior to replacing it.

#### Configuration
* Expiration Reminder: With the Expiration Reminder you can set a convenient time to get a notification to replace your Pod. Using the standard setting Loop sets it default to a full 3 days. You can set the reminder to any day and time up until 80 hours. This changes the PDM default which sets the alert always to 2 hours before a full 3-day (72 hours) run. This assumes you will not have run out of insulin before that time. In the event your pod runs out of insulin, then you will get an pod empty notification.

* Change Time Zone: If you are traveling for short periods of time, you do not have to worry about changing the time on your pod. However, if you are going to be away from home for longer periods of time, you will want to udpate your pod's basal schedule to match local time by selecting the `Change Time Zone` command when convenient. Using this command will move your basal schedule on your current pod to the new time. If you start a new pod session the new time zone will be used. Please wait until you see `Succeeded` appear on the page to ensure the command has successfully been received by the pod.

* Test Command: This command is used only by the developers to test Omnipod commands in Loop. It currently issues a "get status" command and can be used to update your screen details if needed or force a fault error to generate in the issue report after getting a screaming pod.

#### Status

This section provides information about your pod's status. 

* Bolus Delivery: This line will let you know the % progress of any ongoing bolus. 

* Basal Delivery: This line will let you know if basal delivery is active ("schedule") or if it is suspended.

* Alarms: If your pod is screaming or beeping an alarm, this line will display information about the alarm. By clicking on this line, you can clear or "snooze" the alarm status.

* Reservoir: Pods do not report the volume of insulin remaining in the reservoir until there is less than 50 units remaining. So, typically you will see "50+ U" in this line for quite sometime in a new pod.

* Insulin Delivered: This line is the total amount of insulin, both basal and bolus, delivered by the pod since it was activated.

## Next Step: Add CGM

Congrats! You've added your pod to your Loop app. Now, click on the `Done` button in the upper right corner of your Pump Settings screen to take you back to the Loop's settings. Your next step is to [Add CGM](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/operation/loop-settings/cgm/) to your Loop app. After all, without CGM data, your Loop won't loop.
