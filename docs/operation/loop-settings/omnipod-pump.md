# Omnipod Users

Your Loop won’t have much showing initially until we get some basic settings input. The beginning step will be to add a pump to your Loop. If you are using an Omnipod pump, you can follow along for the rest of this page. If, however, you are using a Medtronic pump, please head over to [this page](mdt-pump.md) instead.

## Select Pump Type

Let’s start by clicking on the Loop Settings button in the toolbar at the bottom of your Loop app. It looks like a little sprocket. On the settings screen that opens, click on `Add Pump` and select the **Omnipod** option that appears.

## Select RileyLink

A list of all RileyLinks in the nearby area will display in the RileyLink Setup screen. Select your RileyLink by sliding the toggle to display green and then press the blue `Continue` button at the bottom of the screen. If your RileyLink does not appear, make sure that its switch is turned on (switch slide up toward the case's keyring) and lipo is charged.

!!! info "New RileyLink"

    New RileyLinks won't have a name listed next to their slider at first. The name will only be displayed after connecting a RileyLink to a Loop for the first time. So, if all you see in the device list is a little toggle off to the left and no "RileyLink" name...go ahead and switch that toggle. The RileyLink name will appear after that toggle is green.

## Delivery Limits and Basals

The next screen will offer two areas where you will need to enter information:

* Delivery Limits: Delivery Limits are both your maximum basal rate and your maximum bolus amount. Your maximum basal rate will limit how aggressive your Loop will be able to set temporary basals to treat high blood glucose. Typically, new users should set this value conservatively around 3 times your highest scheduled basal rate until your comfort and experience with Loop develops.

* Basal Rates: Enter your scheduled basal rates, beginning at midnight. Consistent with Omnipod use, the scheduled basal rates have a maximum of 24 entries, no 0 u/hr entries allows, and rate increments of 0.05 u/hr.

When you finish entering these values, press the blue `Continue` button on the bottom of the Pod Settings screen to continue with the next steps of Pod setup.

## Pair Pod

1. Place the Pod near RileyLink
2. Fill the Pod with insulin until it beeps (minimum fill is 80 units)
3. Click the `Pair` button
4. Wait while the progress bar for priming completes
5. Press the `Continue` button when the blue checkmark confirms priming is complete

## Insert Cannula

1. Prepare your insertion site
2. Remove the Pod's needle cap and adhesive backing
3. If the cannula is safely tucked away, apply the Pod to your desired infusion site. If cannula is sticking out, press `cancel` in the upper right corner of the screen and try a new Pod.
4. Press the `Insert Cannula` button.
5. Listen to the clicks filling the cannula, wait for insertion and the progress bar to complete. The number of clicks to insertion is not consistent. The cannula will deploy before the progress bar is completed.
6. Confirm cannula has deployed by looking through the peep-hole on the Pod.
7. Press the `Continue` button

## Expiration Reminder

Finish the setup using the default expiration reminder time (2 hours before a full 3-days usage). You can modify that expiration reminder at any time, see [Expiration Reminder](pump-commands.md#expiration-reminder). The notification will come from Loop; your Pod will not beep at this time. Setup is complete and your Pod is ready for use when you press the final button.

## Pod Settings

After the Pod setup is completed, you will be on the Pod Settings screen. The information on this screen is described in [Omnipod Pump Commands](pump-commands.md#omnipod-commands).


## Next Step: Add CGM

Congrats! You've added your Pod to your Loop app. Now, click on the `Done` button in the upper right corner of your Pump Settings screen to take you back to the Loop's settings. Your next step is to [Add CGM](cgm.md) to your Loop app. After all, without CGM data, your Loop won't loop.
