# Loop Tips

These docs are a great resource for the technical aspects of building your Loop app.  However, they don't really cover in detail a lot of the frequently asked questions about *USING* Loop. 

Things such as:

* How to enter low treatments while using Loop?</br></br>
* What to discuss with your Endo?</br></br>
* What data reports might be useful?</br></br>
* How to deal with failed sites?</br></br>
* What about pizza boluses?</br></br>
* What do I do when I shower or swim?</br></br>

All of those usability questions and more are addressed over in the companion site called [Looptips](https://looptips.org).  

Please head over to Looptips in order to read some really helpful tips to make your Looping easier.
