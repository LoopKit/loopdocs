# Loop Tips

These docs are a great resource for the technical aspects of building your Loop
app. However, they don't really cover in detail a lot of the frequently asked
questions about _USING_ Loop.

Things such as:

- How to enter low treatments while using Loop?</br></br>
- What to discuss with your Endo?</br></br>
- What data reports might be useful?</br></br>
- How to deal with failed sites?</br></br>
- What about pizza boluses?</br></br>
- What do I do when I shower or swim?</br></br>

All of those usability questions and more are addressed over in the companion
site called [Looptips](https://looptips.org).

Please head over to Looptips in order to read some really helpful tips to make
your Looping easier.
