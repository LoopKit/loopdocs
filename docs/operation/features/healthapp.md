# Health App

Loop app uses the iPhone's Health app to store BGs, insulin, and carbohydrate
data. Insulin Data is a new feature with iOS 11. You can check your Health App
settings for Loop by opening the Health App, clicking on Sources at the bottom
bar, and then clicking on the Loop app.

Summaries of your carbohydrates, insulin, and BG results can be found by
clicking on the Health Data at the bottom bar, and then selecting either the
large Nutrition box (for carbohydrates) or smaller Results line (for insulin
deliveries and BG results).

If you toggle on the "add to favorites" slider for the individual data
categories (insulin, BGs, carbohydrates), the data from those categories will be
added to your Today view for easy quick reference and access.

The summary data for the categories can help you follow monthly trends, help
identify periods of insulin sensitivity/resistance, evaluate total daily insulin
use, breakdown of basal vs bolus insulin, and carbohydrate consumptions. You can
sort your data trends by day, week, month, or year views and scroll back through
time in each of those data trends. You can even quickly use these data for
endocrinology appointments discussions...as they provide the endocrinologist
with a very quick and useful set of data points directly from your Loop system.
