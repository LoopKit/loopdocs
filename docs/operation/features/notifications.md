# Loop Notifications

Loop provides discrete notifications on the iPhone and Watch which will appear
on the (locked) screen and vibrate, depending on your notification settings of
Loop.

Most beep alarms are disabled for a much more discrete use of the omnipod. Only
the following audible acknowledgments or alarms are currently used:

- Pod activated acknowledgment when filling the pod with enough insulin when
  pairing a new Pod.
- Pod expiration advisory alarm at 72 hours/3 days (which you can silence in the
  [pod status settings](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/operation/loop-settings/omnipod-pump/#status))
- Pod empty reservoir (which you can silence in the
  [pod status settings](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/operation/loop-settings/omnipod-pump/#status))
- Pod deactivation acknowledgment
- Pod fault alarm (also called a screamer) when reaching the max life of the
  Pod: 80 hours (3 days + 8 hours) or a fault/occlusion happens. (which you can
  silence using the
  [replace pod](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/operation/loop-settings/omnipod-pump/#pod-commands))
  command in the pod settings page)

## Loop Failure

At 20, 40, 60, and 120 minutes, there is a Loop Failure notification. This
mostly happens when the connection is lost for a longer period of time between
the CGM or the Rileylink and Loop.

## Bolus Failure

If Loop detects that a bolus was not able to be delivered, it will provide a
notification. Bolus failures are usually due to stale pump data. Try fetching
recent history from the RileyLink menu to update pump data. Loop will also
notify of partial bolus deliveries.

## Empty Reservoir

Loop will notify when the reservoir is empty. Loop will notify you every minute
with this notification.

<font color ="orange">**Omnipod**</font>  
Normally you will have 5-30 minutes to replace the pod, but do know the pod can
[scream](https://soundcloud.com/eelke-jager/1f-nibble-f) at any moment from this
point on.

## Pod Expiration (Omnipod)

You can customize the time of notification when to replace your pod any time
from 1 hour up to 71 hours (3 days - 1 hour)
[after staring a new pod](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/operation/loop-settings/omnipod-pump/#expiration-reminder)
or you change the time later in the
[pod configuration settings](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/operation/loop-settings/omnipod-pump/#configuration).
The expiry alarm will always sound when the pod reaches a running full 3 days
(72 hours) which you can silence
[in the pod status settings](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/operation/loop-settings/omnipod-pump/#status).

## Low Battery (Medtronic)

Loop will notify when battery levels have approximately 8-10 hours of battery
life remaining.

## Remote Notifications

Loop does not have a remote notification to other devices. If you are a remotely
monitoring parent, you will want to read
[here](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/nightscout/pushover/#pushover) about
setting up pushover alerts using your Nightscout site if you want proactive
notifications of looping related information.
