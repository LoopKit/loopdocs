# Workout Targets

Workout mode enables a temporary override target from what would normally be
scheduled. The default durations for the workout mode override target are 1
hour, 2 hours, or indefinitely. If you want more options for duration, you can
[customize them during your Loop build](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/build/code_customization/#workout-range-duration).

Workout mode is used to temporarily set higher BG targets ahead of exercise that
would normally cause BG to drop. This should give the user less chance of going
low during exercise because Loop will be less aggressive on setting high temp
basals. The success of the workout targets to control/prevent exercise-related
BG drops will depend on the type, duration, and intensity of the activity.
Generally the more intense the workout, the farther in advance you would want to
set a workout target.

If you find that workout targets alone aren't sufficient to prevent exercise
related lows, try to implement ways of decreasing the IOB you are carrying into
the workout:

- Set the workout target farther in advance of workout activity,
- Set the workout target higher than previously set, and/or
- Decrease meal boluses prior to workout.

If you are the type to experience lows after workouts due to increased insulin
sensitivity, you may want to extend your workout override target for a period of
time after workout to help prevent lows.
