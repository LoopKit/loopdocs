There are several methods to build Loop-dev. First review the general information on this page then choose the link for the method of your choice:

## Update Frequently

While Loop-dev is under active development, you should monitor zulipchat and update frequently. Sometimes the `dev` branch is quiet for months at a time and other times there are more frequent changes. Please pay attention. 

Checking for updates every week is a good idea. Also - subscribe to all the streams on [Loop Zulipchat](https://loop.zulipchat.com) to make sure you don't miss critical information.

## Loop-dev Version

The version of code that shows up under the Loop Settings screen is incremented whenever the `dev branch` is modified, as explained in [Loop Version Numbering](releases.md#loop-version-numbering){: target="_blank" }.

If you need help with your app, the mentors need to know you are running a `dev` branch and the specific version that shows on your settings screen.
