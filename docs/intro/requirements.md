## Two Ways to Build the App

With the release of&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop 3</span>_&nbsp;, there are two ways to build the app.

* If you have never built&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;before:
    * If you already own a Mac then you may prefer the Build with Mac method
    * For all others, you will probably prefer the Build with Browser method

The Build Steps have been split into two tabs:

* [Build with Browser](../browser/bb-overview.md)
    * Build with a browser on any computer or tablet
    * App is installed on the iPhone using *TestFlight*
* [Build with *Mac*](../build/overview.md)
    * App is built on a *Mac* with *Xcode* connected to the iPhone
    * The operating system on the *Mac* and the version of *Xcode* must be kept up-to-date

There are some requirements common to both methods. Some requirements are specific to only one method.

## Common Requirements

These requirements are independent of how you build the Loop app:

1. [Compatible iPhone](../build/phone.md)
1. [Compatible Pump](../build/pump.md)
1. [Compatible CGM](../build/cgm.md)
1. [RileyLink Compatible Device](../build/rileylink.md)
    * Not needed with Omnipod DASH or SOOIL Dana pumps (i or RS)
    * Required for Medtronic and Omnipod Eros
1. [Apple Developer Membership](../build/apple-developer.md)
    * If building for a child, be sure to read [Loopers Need Their Own Apple ID](../build/apple-developer.md#loopers-need-their-own-apple-id)
    * Build with Browser - requires a paid developer account
    * Build with *Mac* - can build a free version with some limitations and must rebuild weekly

### Added Requirements to [Build with Browser](../browser/bb-overview.md){: target="_blank" }

If you plan to build using the Build with Browser instructions, you also need:

1.  A free *GitHub* account

Detailed instructions are included in the link above.

### Added Requirements to [Build with *Mac*](../build/overview.md){: target="_blank" }

If you plan to build using the Build with *Mac* instructions, you also need:

1. [Compatible Computer](../build/computer.md#check-your-macos-version)
1. [Xcode](../build/xcode-version.md) (a free Apple application)


## Getting Ready to Build

Go through the Common Requirements to see what you need to actually Loop.

!!! tip "Simulator Option"
    If you want to test the Loop app without attaching CGM or pump hardware, you can run a simulated CGM or simulated pump. You can use actual CGM data using Dexcom Share or Nightscout as a Remote CGM.

    These simulators are part of the Loop app and are available with either build method you choose.
    
    Check out the [Simulator](../version/simulator.md){: target="_blank" } page.

Once you have chosen your Build Method, go through the pages for that build method several times before beginning, especially if this is new to you.

When you are ready to proceed, work through the tasks on each page. Take your time. You can do one a day, take a week per page or blaze through them quickly.  Just be sure to read carefully and if you are confused - reach out for help: [How to Find Help](../intro/loopdocs-how-to.md#how-to-find-help).

After you build Loop on your phone, keep following along in the docs as you [Set up](../loop-3/loop-3-overview.md) and [Operate](../operation/loop/open-loop.md) your Loop app.

## Next Steps:

### Review the Common Requirements

Before you start either build method, review the Common Requirements. First one is [Compatible iPhone](../build/phone.md). On each page, keep clicking Next (or n) until you've finished with the Intro pages and are ready to Build.

### Build with Browser

Click on the link if you are done reviewing the common requirements and you want to skip ahead to [Build with Browser](../browser/bb-overview.md).

### Build with *Mac*

Click on the link if you are done reviewing the common requirements and you want to skip ahead to [Build with *Mac*](../build/overview.md).
