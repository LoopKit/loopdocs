# Turning Your Grey Loop to Green

When you are initially starting the Loop app, the Loop will be colored grey.
Wait about 15-20 minutes for the Loop to turn from grey to green. There's a bit
of time for Loop to pull all of those first pieces of data together, especially
reading your pump history for the first time. If the Loop remains grey after
15-20 min, there are several possible causes for this. If you find yourself with
a grey loop that just won't turn green, check these most frequently missed items
on new setups:

## Pump

- Max basal rate in Loop app is no greater than the max basal rate in pump
  settings
- Temp basal type in the pump's basal menu is set to "Insulin Rate (U/hr)" and
  not "Percent of Basal"

## CGM

- Dexcom app installed on the looping iPhone and open
- CGM getting current values without interruption
- Loop app has a CGM value displayed in the top bar of the main display

## RileyLink

- RL is charged (it does not ship completely charged)
- RL battery needs to be securely plugged in,
  [check those connections](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/setup/requirements/rileylink/#assembling-rl)

## Loop Settings

- Correct CGM system has been selected in Loop settings
- Insulin curve has been selected
- Suspend Threshold has been entered

!!! info "" The most common delay in getting a grey loop to turn green is
probably the lack of CGM data. If you have waited 15-20 minutes and no CGM data
has appeared, try closing both the Loop and Dexcom apps (double-tap home button
and up-swipe to close apps). Toggle your BT on iPhone off/on. Reopen the Loop
app, then reopen Dexcom app.

If all else fails after verifying the settings listed in the sections above, you
can:

- Close and restart the Loop and Dexcom apps
- Toggle BT off/on
- Turn RileyLink off/on
- Replace pump battery
