# CGM FAQs

## What CGMs does Loop work with?

Loop works Dexcom G4 with share, G5, G6, Share and the Medtronic CGM systems compatible with Looping pumps.

Read the details [here](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/setup/requirements/cgm/).

## Can I use Libre sensors with a reader like Miao Miao?

If you want to use a sensor, such as Libre, you will need to modify Loop to accomplish that use. Loop code does not natively support that sensor, nor reader. 

## Can Loop read CGM data from Nightscout?

Loop does not read from, nor upload to, CGM data for Nightscout. You would need to use a solution such as NightscoutShareServer and make changes to Loop code in order to do that. Please search the Looped group in Facebook for posts regarding that option, as it is not a part of standard Loop use and is a community-based modification. You will need to do your homework and research to make that happen.

## Can Spike or Xdrip be used with Loop?

Spike and Xdrip are not supported by Loop. You will need to implement community-based modifications to Loop in order to use those apps with Loop. Please search the Looped group in Facebook for posts regarding those options, as they are not a part of standard Loop use.
