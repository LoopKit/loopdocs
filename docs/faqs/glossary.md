# Glossary

Each item in the glossary is also a tooltip.

A tooltip is visible as a dashed underline word or phrase.

If you hover your mouse or tap on a mobile device, the phrase associated with each word is displayed.

**Certificate**: Apple certificate is used to sign your iOS or Mac apps - tied to but different from your permanent Developer ID

**CGM**: continuous glucose monitor, wearable medical device that measures and reports glucose in interstitial fluid

**Closed Loop**: Loop will make automated adjustments of insulin delivery using predictions based off user entries, settings, IOB and COB

**clone**: create a copy of a repository on your computer including revision history and ability to update using git commands

**COB**: Carbs on Board, affects automated insulin delivery: the g of carbohydrates that Loop expects to be absorbed and uses for glucose prediction

**Config Vars**: configuration parameters for a Nightscout Site

**Correction Range**: Loop recommends changes to basal and / or bolus to bring glucose predictions into this range

**CR**: Carb Ratio; how many grams of carbs are covered by one unit of rapid-acting insulin

**Delivery Limits**: max bolus and max basal rates allowed by your therapy settings

**DIA**: Duration of Insulin Action, the full time insulin is active including a long, low-level tail

**Dosing Strategy**: chosen method for increased insulin dosing: (1) High Temp Basal or (2) Automatic Bolus with scheduled basal

**dynos**: used to reboot a Nightscout Site

**EmaLink**: radio-frequency device Loop uses to control Eros pods and older Medtronic pumps

**Event History**: record of pump events (bolus or temp basal) reported and used by Loop

**Expiration Date**: your Loop app has a finite life, the app warns you starting 3 weeks before the expiration date

**Finder**: graphical folder and file display on Mac

**GIF**: Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) can be used for small animations and low-resolution video clips

**git**: a tool for version control

**Glucose Chart**: Display of measured and predicted glucose values

**Glucose Safety Limit**: Loop will not suggest insulin delivery when glucose prediction (in next 3 hours) goes below this limit

**Guardrails**: limits in the code for user selected settings, recommended and absolute limits are provided

**Hamburger Menu**: three parallel lines that, when tapped, open a new menu

**HUD**: Heads-Up Display at top of Loop main screen, phone in portrait mode

**ICE**: Insulin Counteraction Effect - Loop models the expected glucose change based on carbs entered, absorption time and your settings; and adjusts based on measured glucose

**IOB**: Insulin on Board, affects automated insulin delivery: the current active insulin (above or below the basal rate) that Loop calculates and uses for glucose prediction

**iOS**: operating system used by Apple Mobile devices (iPhone, iPod)

**ISF**: Insulin Sensitivity Factor; how many points your blood sugar will drop for each unit of insulin

**Issue**: On github - a formal method to report a problem, either code behavior or documentation

**macOS**: operating system for Mac computer

**Lock your Phone**: click the button on the side of the phone to lock it - prevent accidental touch, i.e., accidental Loop command

**Loop Cycle**: typically 5 minutes: new CGM reading, prediction update, pump update and, if in Closed Loop, dosing update if needed

**MTB**: Manual Temp Basal: user initiated temporary basal, Omnipod Common feature

**MDT**: common abbreviation for Medtronic pumps

**modal**: message or alert appearing in front of app that must be acknowledged to return to app

**Monterey**: operating system for Mac, macOS 12.x

**Omnipod**: Insulet tubeless insulin pump; Loop supports Eros (with RileyLink) and DASH

**Open Loop**: Loop will not make automated adjustments of insulin delivery but all prediction and recommendation features are available

**OrangeLink**: radio-frequency device Loop uses to control Eros pods and older Medtronic pumps

**OTP**: one-time password, this is used to enable caregivers to securely execute remote commands to a Looper's phone

**Override**: a modification to Loop settings that can change the correction range, the sensitivity (basal, ISF and CR) or both

**Package Dependencies**: packages that must be downloaded by Xcode (once) to build the app after downloading the LoopWorkspace to your computer

**pill**: on Nightscout, small boxes with information, tap for extra details

**PR**: Pull Request - a formal method to request changes to a repository

**Pre-Meal Range**: modify the correction range for up to one-hour by tapping on an icon in the toolbar

**Provisioning Profile**: associates your app with your Developer ID and limits app lifetime to 1 year (paid) or 1 week (free)

**Pull Request**: formal method to request changes to a repository

**Quit the Loop App**: quit out of the app - different from closing the app - typically you swipe up in the app switcher

**repository**: contains project files and each file's revision history

**RileyLink**: radio-frequency device Loop uses to control Eros pods and older Medtronic pumps

**Rosetta**: allows apps built for older Macs (Intel chips) to run on newer Macs (M1 chips)

**SAGE**: sensor age on Nightscout site

**submodules**: for Loop, submodules are repositories defined in the Workspace repository that are required to build the app

**Table of Contents**: for the LoopDocs website, the TOC is the list of level 2 and 3 headers. The name of the page is a level 1 header.

**Temp Basal Only**: provide the recommended insulin automatically using an increase in temp basal over half an hour (limited by max temp basal)
