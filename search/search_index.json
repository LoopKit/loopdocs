Read Posting for Help</p> <p>Before you start trying to resolve your red errors, start with the most obvious things that can cause a red error message:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Did you forget to select Loop(WorkSpace)? The first time you build after downloading new code, you must manually select Loop (Workspace) instead of Loop in Xcode.</p> </li> <li> <p>Did you check that you have the minumum Xcode version for your iOS? This is critical. If you are updating your Loop app, please review the iOS driven requirements for minimum version of macOS and Xcode.</p> </li> <li> <p>Did you check your Apple developer account for new license agreement? Periodically, Apple will release a new developer license agreement that you need to sign before you can build new apps. You will get a build failure if there is a pending license agreement to sign. Login to your Apple developer account to check if there's a new license agreement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you have a new computer, never used to build Loop? Did you Add Apple ID to Xcode?</p> </li> <li> <p>Did you reboot, i.e., restart, your computer after updating Xcode? You should reboot following Xcode installation or update and you must make sure your command line tools match the version of Xcode you just installed. Xcode Command Line Tools</p> </li> <li> <p>Did you get a fresh download of Loop code? If you tried to build with an old download that you used a long time ago, that old version may not be compatible with the new iOS and Xcode versions. Check also, that you are actually using the new download in Xcode.  When you use the Build Select Script, it automatically opens Xcode using the new download.</p> <p>If you want to build using a recent download, this section tells you how to Find My Downloaded Loop Code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Are you are using a free developer account?

Check to make sure the serial number of the pump on the backside matches the serial number of the pump showing in the display menu. Ask for a short video of the pump, or at least a photo of the pump turned on, so that you can see the pump's firmware and model number. Cracks and some wear on these pumps are expected. These pumps are not usually free of marks. Many people are successfully looping on pumps that have cracks and rub marks, but you may want to ask if you are concerned about any you see in photos.</p> </li> <li> <p>Beware if the bottom of the reservoir/motor sleeve has the drive support cap pushed out, as shown here. Those pumps will generally not work (or only work intermittently), however some people have successfully repaired those pumps as shown in that link. Just be aware that it should be checked in advance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repairs to cracks or missing bits of plastic on battery cap area and reservoir caps are possible and not very difficult in most situations.

Answer: No. You will only be able to enact override presets already programmed into the Loop app.</p> </li> <li> <p>If I didn't start the override in Nightscout (it was started in Loop itself), can I still use Nightscout to cancel it? Answer: Yes. You can cancel a Loop-set override with a Nightscout-set cancel \"temporary override\" command in careportal.</p> </li> <li> <p>Can I override a Loop-set override with a Nightscout-set override? Answer: Yes.</p> </li> <li> <p>If I have multiple Nightscout sites because I have multiple kiddos with T1D looping, do I need multiple APNs Keys? Answer: No. If you have multiple kids looping, you can use the one APNs key in each of their Nightscout sites.</p> </li> <li> <p>How can I tell if it worked? Answer: You should see your override pill in Nightscout, with the NEXT Loop cycle, reflecting that the desired override action took place. If you are near the Loop app, you should see the new override within less than 30 seconds or so.</p> </li> <li> <p>Can I see on Nightscout when a temporary override has been set using the looper\u2019s phone? Yes. There will be a grey bar with the name of the override noted and the Loop Pill will display the targets and duration. Remember, there is a KNOWN issue with the grey bars, so use the pill as your best guide.</p> </li> <li> <p>Can a looper cancel a remote override? Yes. They can tap the heart icon in Loop so that it is no longer highlighted. This turns off the override, regardless of where it was initiated.</p> </li> <li> <p>I set a remote override in Nightscout but the looper tapped the heart symbol in the Loop app, so the override turned off. Will the override get reinstated next time Loop completes with internet access? No. The APN is only sent once. You can set the remote override again if need be.</p> </li> <li> <p>Can I schedule a remote override ahead of time using Nightscout? No. When you set a remote override in Nightscout, it will begin immediately and last for whatever duration is programmed for that override in the Loop app. You can set an override for ahead of time using the Looping App only.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"nightscout/remote-overrides/#warnings-for-remote-commands","title":"Warnings for Remote Commands","text":"<p>Duplicate Delivery Risk</p> <p>We want to highlight a very important risk before you get started.</p> <p>For safety, always assume a previous remote carb / bolus was delivered.

The insulin activity duration is 6 hours for Loop's rapid-acting and ultra-rapid insulin models. Correction range The correction range is the blood glucose range Loop uses to determine corrective actions (e.g., between 90 and 120 mg/dL in the figure). NOTE: Loop\u2019s correction range is a user setting and should not be confused with the target range, typically 70-180 mg/dL, used for the purpose of calculating the percent time in range. Correction minimum The lower or minimum value of the user\u2019s correction range, which is 90 mg/dL in the figure. Correction maximum The upper or maximum value of the user\u2019s correction range, which is 120 mg/dL in the figure. Correction target The correction target is the average value of the correction range. In the overview figure, this is 105 mg/dL given that the correction minimum is 90 mg/dL and the correction maximum is 120 mg/dL. Predicted blood glucose Loop makes a prediction of blood glucose values out for a length of time equal to your insulin action duration. The predicted blood glucose is the basis for how Loop makes its insulin delivery recommendations and actions. Eventual blood glucose The last value of the predicted glucose curve, in other words the very last blood glucose predicted at the end of your insulin action duration. In the figure above, this is 85 mg/dL. Minimum predicted blood glucose The lowest blood glucose value at any point in time within the prediction. In the figure above, this is 77 mg/dL. Delta The delta is the difference between the eventual blood glucose and the correction target. In the overview figure, the eventual blood glucose is 85 mg/dL and the correction target is 105 mg/dL, which means that the delta is  -20 mg/dL. Suspend Threshold The suspend threshold is a safety feature of the Loop algorithm. If any predicted blood glucose is below this threshold, the Loop algorithm will issue a temporary basal rate of 0 CGM data Blood glucose readings made by a continuous glucose monitor. Insulin sensitivity factor A configuration value that provides an estimate of how much blood glucose will drop given a unit of insulin. Active insulin Active insulin, often referred to as Insulin-on-Board (IOB), is the remaining amount of insulin activity from boluses and temporary basal rates relative to a user\u2019s scheduled basal rates. More specifically, it is the total amount of insulin activity due to all bolus and basal insulin delivered within the last N hours, where N is determined by the insulin activity duration. The amount of \u201cactive\u201d insulin depends upon the insulin activity curve, and also accounts for the insulin withheld via basal suspensions. As such, it is possible that the active insulin can be negative. Negative active insulin will result in an increase in predicted blood glucose. The active insulin displayed in Loop's main display does not reflect the currently enacted temporary basal rate, as that basal rate may be canceled or modified before completion over the next 30 minutes. In others words, Loop doesn't count chickens before the eggs hatch...insulin delivery must be confirmed before being added to the active insulin reporting."},{"location":"operation/algorithm/overview/#algorithm-section-menu","title":"Algorithm Section Menu","text":"<ul> <li>Algorithm Overview<ul> <li>Bolus Recommendations</li> <li>Blood Glucose Prediction</li> <li>Temp Basal Adjustments</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"operation/algorithm/prediction/","title":"Glucose Prediction","text":""},{"location":"operation/algorithm/prediction/#blood-glucose-prediction","title":"Blood Glucose Prediction","text":"<p>Loop uses an algorithm to maintain blood glucose in a correction range by predicting the contributions from four individual effects (insulin, carbohydrates, retrospective correction, and blood glucose momentum) at any time t to recommend temporary basal rate corrections and boluses.</p> \\[ BG[t] = Insulin[t] + Carb[t] + RetrospectiveCorrection[t] + Momentum[t] \\] <p>You can see the individual contributions of these effects by tapping on the predicted blood glucose chart on Loop's status screen.

More technically said, a battery discharge curve is the measure of volts that a battery puts out over time.  Batteries start at a higher voltage output and slowly that voltage output degrades over time (or use) until the battery no longer provides enough \"ummph\" to keep the electronic gadget going.

They programmed their pump battery level indicator to change from 4 bars to 3 bars to 2 bars to 1 bar based on that particular discharge curve.</p> <p>However, Loop users are slightly more demanding on the pump's battery/voltage than simply delivering insulin.  We are also asking for the pump to perform radio communications, in addition to delivering insulin.  Those radio communications need a slightly higher voltage than the typical \"normal\" pump use.

BGs climbed a bit more, not surprising given how we were underestimating fast carbs at this point...but still not so bad at 180 peak BG.  (Anna gave 2 units correction at the peak because there was dessert coming later that night and she wanted to be ready for it without too much pre-bolus.)</p> <p></p> <p>So, how can I use the ICE info to make this meal better?  I can look at the observed ICE information and the observed carb entry Loop has recorded to adjust my insulin bolusing the next time we eat this meal.</p> <p>For example, the biggest weakness I had in this (and suspected it even as I did the initial bolus) was that I underestimated the sauce's fast carbs.  I can see this in the observed ICE graph having the early green peaks after the meal, and in the way that the observed carb distribution was more like 7:2 vs my original guess of 8:1 (slow:fast carbs).  Overall, it appears that I guess on overall carb content pretty closely (90g vs. 89g observed).  Next time we have General Tso's chicken, I will likely bolus it as 70g at 5 hours and 20g at 2 hours.</p> <p></p> <p>So remember to check your ICE page at the end of a meal's absorption.  By checking in on the meal's observed behaviors, you'll have a good starting point to fine-tuning any new or unknown carb breakdown.</p> <p>Side note:  remember this conversation is assuming you have basals fairly well set and are not sick.  If other factors could be significantly causing your BGs to swing that Loop doesn't know about (bad sites, illness, or basal rates that need to be adjusted), they may be attributed to ICE when they really aren't food-related.  In those cases, address the underlying cause and then use the ICE pages when you've come back to \"normal\".</p>"},{"location":"operation/features/notifications/","title":"Loop Notifications","text":""},{"location":"operation/features/notifications/#loop-notifications","title":"Loop Notifications","text":"<p>Loop provides discrete notifications on the iPhone and Watch which will appear on the (locked) screen and vibrate, depending on your notification settings of Loop.</p>"},{"location":"operation/features/notifications/#loop-alert-unable-to-reach-pump","title":"Loop Alert - Unable to Reach Pump","text":"<p>With Loop 3, there is a new modal alert that halts all Loop activity until pump communication can be restored.</p> <p></p> <p>When you tap on the Learn More button, another screen appears.

Some will recover fine, others may not. Since you can't know in advance if you might lose the pod, it is important to have already exhausted other possibilities described above in Steps 1-4 to try pairing. Specifically, (1) attempting to pair several times using varied relative positions of the RileyLink and pod (2) trying the pairing again but in a different room/location that might have less wireless interference, and (3) verifying your RileyLink is connected and functioning correctly.</p> <p>For this next part, we want to make sure that the pod doesn't accidentally receive the deactivation command we are about to use. We want Loop to do the command...we just really don't want the pod to hear it. There's two ways we can keep the pod from hearing it, either (1) prevent the RileyLink from hearing Loop's command (and thus the command cannot reach the pod) or (2) prevent the pod from hearing the command from RileyLink. To accomplish our keep-the-pod-ignorant goal, you can try either option like so:</p> <ol> <li>Prevent RileyLink from hearing: Turn your RileyLink off temporarily at its physical switch. Some people worry about accidentally breaking their RileyLink switch, and if that's you...you can instead put the RileyLink far away from your iPhone or put the RileyLink in the microwave. That will keep the RileyLink from hearing the Loop's deactivate pod command. If RileyLink can't hear it, then your pod won't receive it.</li> <li>Prevent pod from hearing: Move the beeping pod to a place that the pod is incapable of hearing the command. There's several options depending on what works for you:<ul> <li>Put the beeping pod far away...\"shouldn't be able to hear those beeps anymore\" kind of distance.</li> <li>Put the pod in a not-turned-on-but-door-is-closed microwave.</li> <li>Put the pod in a faraday bag, if you own one.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Ok. Have the pod nice and ignorant? Good. Now press the \"Deactivate Pod\" button. It will take a few attempts, and you will see some failure messages about how the deactivation failed (of course it did...we hid the pod!) Eventually, you'll be given an \"Continue\" button that you'll want to use.</p> <p></p> <p>Press the \"Continue\" button. The instructions start with \"fill a new pod with insulin\"...BUT DO NOT!  Instead, bring that beeping pod back to the hearing range. Turn that RileyLink back on if you turned it off. Once you get the RileyLink on and the pod back in range, you'll just press the Pair button and hopefully you'll find success with the process. If this pairing attempt is still unsuccessful, remember to still exhaust repositioning and Step 4 options before giving up on that pod. If it really won't pair after all that...then mark that loser pod with a Sharpie-drawn sad face and follow the directions in Step 3's colored box so that you don't end up with multiple beeping pods around accidentally.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"troubleshooting/pod-pairing/#step-6-help-improve-pod-pairing-process","title":"Step 6: Help improve pod pairing process","text":"<p>To help fix pairing bugs, some improvements have also been made in our ability to save the communications between the pods and Loop app during the pairing process.

Loop has moved on to using only one stable branch (master), with dev recommended for developer/testers.</p>"},{"location":"version/development/#loop-github-information","title":"Loop GitHub Information","text":"<p>Loop developers own an account in GitHub called LoopKit.  Within that account, the developers have several \"repositories\" that support Loop in particular. A repository is like a book...let's think of it like a cookbook for now. Within the LoopKit account, there are repositories for Loop itself, LoopDocs, and various other supporting \"frameworks\" that are helper repositories for Loop to build correctly. For example, Loop's repo has a lot of the info about the app itself; the outward facing things that you interact with. How information is put to you and taken in from you...that's in Loop repository code. But, there's more than just a user interface for Loop. Loop has to do a lot of complex work like Bluetooth communications, algorithm math, pump communications, etc. The Loop app has help from frameworks to do those other parts. CGMBLEkit for some of the transmitter parts of Loop, RileyLink_ios for the pump managers (talking to the pumps and decoding their information), LoopKit for the algorithm about carbs and insulin curves, etc.</p> <p>When you build Loop, in the background, Loop pulls those other frameworks (7 in total) into the build process using \"Carthage\".  Carthage is like a personal shopper. You give it a shopping list (the cartfile in Loop code is that shopping list) and it goes and fetches that for you during the build process. Sometimes your computer has an old shopping list...and that can cause build errors. Hence the \"carthage update\" fix in the Build Errors page...that command updates the shopping list to get the right versions of those frameworks.</p> <p></p> <p>Anyways...so now you know about the general structure of Loop and LoopKit in GitHub. Now we can discuss Loop itself a little deeper.</p> <p>So let's imagine Loop as a cookbook. The developers are the authors/chefs of the recipes (code) in the cookbook. The authors spend countless hours testing new recipes, taste testing, documenting improvements. They send the drafts to the editor, who makes suggestions and eventually the cookbook is finalized. There are no grammar issues, no typos, the photos are beautiful and the recipes are yummy. They publish the book and you see a gorgeous final product on the shelves. That is called a \"release\" and it is the master branch. This book has been well-tested and is super stable. Every time you cook with those recipes, you know exactly what you're getting and lots of people have had a chance before you to make sure that it all tastes good. Master branch is stable and tested.</p> <p>But then...the chefs/developers go on a trip. They are inspired by new cuisine and want to add new recipes to the old cookbook. (Things like omnipod support and overrides are new \"recipes\" that were developed since the last master release, for example.) But, the process for developing a recipe is arduous. Lots of trial and error involved. Lots of tweaking ingredients (code). The editors try out the new recipes and offer feedback (similar to the Issues List in GitHub). While the recipes are being developed, they have a version of the old cookbook that gets marked up...edited in pencil a lot. Scribbles and notes in the side. Revisions happen frequently, because that's what testing new recipes is all about. These marked-up versions of the cookbook are called \"dev\" branch. Short for \"development\" branch. Like the name sounds...this is where new developments are happening, new recipes and tweaks.</p> <p>After much testing and tweaking, eventually the recipes get the flavors right (bugs in code are squashed) and enough people have provided feedback and careful observations of results...that the book goes to the publishing house for the next printing. The cookbook is republished with an updated edition number and new recipes are highlighted. When this happens in Loop, Loop's master branch is updated with the new features coming from dev (aka, \"dev branch is merged into master branch\"). When that happens, master branch gets another \"release\" version. For that moment, dev and master are exactly the same. They stay the same until the Loop developers start working on the next batch of improvements, could be the next hour even or days later, but the process begins again. The developers will start editing the code again and dropping those edits in dev branch for further development.</p>"},{"location":"version/development/#whats-going-on-in-the-dev-branch","title":"What's going on in the dev branch?","text":"<p>The dev branch, currently v3.3.0, is where the next version of Loop is being developed and tested.</p> <p>If you choose to come into a dev branch build, you need to be aware that dev may update code frequently and unannounced in the traditional sense that most users in Looped group or Instagram would see. Developers are not helped by people being in a dev branch if those users are mistakenly thinking of it as a stable master branch with lots of detailed docs to go with it. People should only use a dev branch build if they EDUCATE themselves on the expectations and how to properly manage dev information and updates. People using dev branch should also have regular access to a computer to be able to rebuild quickly if a new bug/fix is identified.</p> <p>If you choose to use a dev build, you can stay abreast of developments in a number of ways...but they will all require you to do some legwork and keep yourself informed.

I'm only writing up this section for people who are interested in dabbling in code collaborations/customizations that they would want to maintain separately from LoopKit proper.</p> <p>Scenario: You have a friend named DeveloperBob who has his own version of LoopWorkspace that he's customized. DeveloperBob wants you to look at his code customizations and collaborate with him. You need to change the \"git clone\" command to get DeveloperBob's version, not LoopKit's version. And, you'd want to make sure you specify the branch that the new feature is on, too. DeveloperBob should usually include the branch name when he posts/shares. So, the command line might be edited to something like:</p> <p><code>git clone --branch=new-features --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DeveloperBob/LoopWorkspace</code></p> <p>So...if you are trying to grab someone's LoopWorkspace to use it, you'll need to make sure you get the command correct if they don't specify it for you. You can't clone mutliple \"LoopWorkspaces\" into the exact same home directory (because they will have the same name), so you may want to create a subdirectory to put them in. Like you could make a folder called \"DeveloperBob\" and then move into that directory in Terminal before you clone DeveloperBob's LoopWorkspace.</p> <p>How would you do that? Simple <code>cd &amp;&amp; mkdir DeveloperBob</code> would make the new folder in your home directory. And then <code>cd DeveloperBob</code> would move your Terminal app to be working inside the new DeveloperBob folder. So if you wanted to clone DeveloperBob's LoopWorkspace, that would be a good way to keep track of where the code came from.</p> <p>If you ever get in doubt and can't remember where your code was cloned from, you can <code>cd LoopWorkspace</code> to get into the directory and then use <code>git remote -v</code> to tell you where it came from.</p>"},{"location":"version/loopworkspace/#pushing-commits-from-loopworkspace","title":"Pushing commits from LoopWorkspace","text":"<p>So you've got a great idea for a new feature, made those changes to your LoopWorkspace and want to get them into GitHub. Awesome!</p> <p>To understand how to do this, we'll need to understand a bit more about how git keeps track of changes. In git, developers can have different \"branches\" (see What are Branches on the Loop Development page for more details about what a branch is). There are two different types of branches: remote and local. If you were to fork Loop on GitHub, then the branches that you can see on GitHub are \"remote\" branches - they're hosted on the GitHub server. On the other hand, you can also create \"local\" branches that are stored directly on your computer by \"checking out\" the remote branch. You'll need to \"commit\" your changes to the local branch, then \"push\" those changes to the remote branch in order to be able to see them in GitHub. There are specific commands that you can type into the command line to do all of these actions, but I'm not going to go into detail because there are different ways and everyone has their own preference.</p> <p>It's a little easier to think about this with an analogy. Let's say you're working at a company that's creating a cookbook. There's a centralized, production-ready version of the cookbook on their website that all the employees can view. Think of the website version of this cookbook as being like the remote branch. You're assigned to change the pancake recipe in the cookbook. Since the company doesn't want employees to make changes directly to the version of the cookbook that the customers see, you need to make a copy of it on your computer so you can make your changes to the pancake recipe. When you make the personal copy on your computer, it's like \"checking out\" the remote branch. Your copy is like the local branch - you can make whatever changes you want without having to worry about customers accidentally seeing them. When you make an important change to the recipe (like adding a photo or changing the ingredients), you might want to make a note in the edit history so that you can go back to that version of the recipe in case you accidentally make unintended changes - those notes you make would be \"commits\". Once you're happy with the recipe, you'll add it back into the production version of the cookbook on the website, which is similar to what you're doing when you \"push\" your changes.</p> <p>Where do the submodules fit in? Each submodule is actually a branch, so when you make changes to multiple submodules, you'll need to commit those changes to their respective branches. Let's say you've made changes to Loop and LoopKit. You'll need to go into Loop and commit and push the changes, then go into LoopKit and commit and push the changes.</p> <p>There are a few different ways to keep track of all these different branches. Some people like using the command line (which is what you're using when you do commands like <code>git clone</code>) because it's very customizable and has the largest variety of commands. Others like to use graphical Git editors, which make it easier to see changes and be able to do a variety of common actions (like cloning, committing, and pushing) with the push of a button. Everyone has their own preferences, but some methods that Loop contributors have used in the past include the command line, Gitkraken, and SourceTree.</p>"},{"location":"version/overview-version/","title":"Version Overview","text":""},{"location":"version/overview-version/#version-overview","title":"Version Overview","text":"<p>The Version tab of LoopDocs contains information about Loop versions, code customization and development.</p> <p>Map to this section:</p> <ul> <li>Loop Releases<ul> <li>Description of the current released version of Loop including when it was released</li> <li>Reverse chronology of earlier releases</li> </ul> </li> <li>Code Customization<ul> <li>Instructions for customizing your DIY code</li> <li>Think of this as your personalized version</li> </ul> </li> <li>Customize with GitHub<ul> <li>Instructions for customizing using just a browser</li> </ul> </li> <li>Simulator Build<ul> <li>Instructions for building to a simulator</li> </ul> </li> <li>Loop Development<ul> <li>Description of the development process for Loop</li> <li>Information you need if you want to participate</li> </ul> </li> <li>Build Dev<ul> <li>Discussion of methods to build the dev branch</li> </ul> </li> <li>LoopWorkspace<ul> <li>If you are interested in development, this page goes into more detail</li> <li>The primary focus is on techniques for using git</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"version/releases/","title":"Loop Releases","text":""},{"location":"version/releases/#loop-releases","title":"Loop Releases","text":"<p>The new features added with each Loop release (starting with Loop version 2.0) are provided for reference.</p>"},{"location":"version/releases/#loop-3-compatibility","title":"Loop 3 Compatibility","text":"<p>Be aware that Loop 3 is forward compatible:</p> <ul> <li>You can build Loop 3 over older versions of Loop and maintain therapy settings as well as your configuration for CGM and pump (including a pod)</li> <li>You can build Loop 3 using a browser on any computer (no Mac required) with GitHub Browser Build</li> <li>Your phone must be running at least iOS 15.1 (although some people report they needed newer iOS than that when building with GitHub Browser Build)</li> </ul> <p>Loop 3 is NOT backwards compatible.\u00a0Once you build Loop 3 or later on your phone, you cannot return to Loop 2.2.x or FreeAPS without some additional work.</p> <ul> <li>Be prepared to enter all your settings again and start a new pod</li> <li>If you use Loop Follow, you do not need to delete Loop Follow</li> <li>When downgrading to an older version of Loop from Loop 3, you have to delete all apps with a shared app group ID<ul> <li>For more information, click on Remove Apps with Shared App Group</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"version/releases/#current-release","title":"Current Release","text":"<p>The current released version for Loop main is v3.2.1.

This feature can help if/when Dexcom's Share servers ever go through another large outage like we had before. If that happens, you can turn on the \"Upload Readings\" switch and your CGM data will now be in Nightscout even without Share servers working properly. Good practice would be to temporarily disable your Share bridge in Nightscout while Loop is responsible for CGM uploading so that you don't get duplicate data.

What this means is that food absorption was modeled as a flat, even effect (like the straight grey graph that you'll see in the Insulin Counteraction Effects chart after you added a carb entry. But looking at large groups of meals' datasets (and supported by personal, anecdotal experiences), food really has a bit more of a non-linear absorption. Meaning, we usually see more of a food impact up-front than the old carb model in Loop predicted.</p> <p>What did that mismatch mean for us if the model predicts a linear absorption, but the meal actually behaves differently?</p> <ol> <li>Bolusing: You've probably seen smaller upfront boluses for meals than you would have preferred. This is because the insulin was predicted to over-power the linear (slower) carb model soon after a bolus is given.</li> <li>Early low temp basals: You've also probably seen a tendency to have early zero basal or low basals set by Loop for the first 30-60 minutes after a meal bolus if you don't have a significant blood glucose spike immediately after the carb entry. This might have been even more obvious for those of you who are regularly waiting to eat after a bolus, too.</li> </ol> <p>With a non-linear absorption model, the carb absorption will more closely match observed blood glucose impacts we've seen after meals. And when the model is more closely matching actual experience, that means the predicted blood glucose curves will do a better job at providing more upfront bolus and not having the tendency to have overly conservative temp basals soon after a meal.</p>"},{"location":"version/releases/#overrides-introduced","title":"Overrides Introduced","text":"<p>Loop v2.0 marks the first time Loop master branch has overrides included.
