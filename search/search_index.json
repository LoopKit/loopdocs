This is critical. If you are updating your Loop app, please review the iOS driven requirements for minimum version of macOS and Xcode.</p> </li> <li> <p>Did you check your Apple developer account for new license agreement?

This costs nothing for the buyer, but the seller will lose 2.95% of the sale to PayPal fees. PayPal offers some protection for both buyer and seller in the event of fraud.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Ask for photos of the pump. Check to make sure the serial number of the pump on the back matches the serial number of the pump showing in the display menu. Ask for a short video of the pump, or at least a photo of the pump turned on, so that you can see the pump's firmware and model number. Cracks and some wear on these pumps are expected. These pumps are not usually free of marks. Many people are successfully looping on pumps that have cracks and rub marks, but you may want to ask if you are concerned about any you see in photos.</p> </li> <li> <p>Beware if the bottom of the reservoir/motor sleeve has the drive support cap pushed out, as shown here. Those pumps will generally not work (or only work intermittently), however, some people have successfully repaired those pumps as shown in that link. Just be aware that it should be checked in advance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repairs to cracks or missing bits of plastic on battery cap area and reservoir caps are possible and not very difficult in most situations. You can read more about how to repair those here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask for shipping that includes a tracking number. USPS Priority Mail's smallest box is a great option.  It's only $7.20 domestically in the US and includes tracking. Ask the seller to add a small bit of packing protection such as bubble wrap around the pump to keep it safe during shipping. Make sure you get a tracking number within a reasonable period of time after you have paid.  </p> </li> </ul> <p>Red flags that may indicate a scam:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Asking for payment through \"friends and family\" on PayPal, especially if you don't know the person or have any solid references for them. Paying in that way offers you no buyer protection. It's just like giving the seller cash, so you had better trust the seller.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Offering an \"almost new\" pump is a big red flag in the US. Do you really think a more than 10-year old pump would be unused and sitting in shrink wrap at this point? This seems highly suspicious. There are some out there, but they are very rare.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inability to provide new pictures of the pump when requested. Sure they posted some pictures with the ad, but what if they just downloaded them from other people's ads? The seller should be able to furnish a couple of \"new\" photos at your request. A good one to ask for is the battery and reservoir tops so you can see their condition.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"build/pump/#pump-supplies","title":"Pump Supplies","text":"<p>Medtronic will not typically sell pump supplies directly to customers who have not previously purchased a registered Medtronic pump.

You can either let your temp basal finish by itself (30 minutes or less) or cancel the temp basal on the pump's menu. For bolusing, you'd go back to using the pump's bolus commands. When you get a device (either finding your old one or getting your backup device out) and the Loop app running again, you'll want to do one thing. Enter in any carbs to the Loop app that you may have eaten in the recent past that could still be affecting blood glucose. While the Loop app will read whatever insulin deliveries had happened while the RileyLink compatible device was missing, it will not read any carbs you entered into the pump...so make sure to add those to the Loop app and backdate them to the time they were eaten. That will help make the transition back to closed loop smoother.</p> <p>For Pod users, your Pod will finish any currently running temporary basal rate (maximum of 30 minutes) and then revert back to your scheduled basal rate. Without a RileyLink compatible device, you will be receiving normal basals, but will need to pull out pens/syringe for boluses. If you have a backup device, you can simply connect to the new device on the same Loop app and it will work with the existing pod session.

Nightscout can act as a stand-alone tool or be integrated with Loop. (Nightscout also integrates with other open-source hybrid closed loop systems such as OpenAPS, AndroidAPS and iAPS. LoopDocs focuses on Loop.)</p> <p>When integrated with Loop, Nightscout provides monitoring of Loop activities such as viewing history of glucose, carbs, boluses, temp basals and overrides; troubleshooting Loop errors; and provides extensive reports for analyzing data trends and patterns. These reports assist when Loop Therapy Settings need to be adjusted.</p> <p>For caregivers, Nightscout enables remote monitoring and even the ability to issue remote commands through Nightscout when both Loop and Nightscout are properly configured. There are several pages starting at LoopDocs: Remote Overview that provide documentation on this feature.

The insulin activity duration is 6 hours for Loop's rapid-acting and ultra-rapid insulin models. Correction range The correction range is the blood glucose range Loop uses to determine corrective actions (e.g., between 90 and 120 mg/dL in the figure). NOTE: Loop\u2019s correction range is a user setting and should not be confused with the target range, typically 70-180 mg/dL, used for the purpose of calculating the percent time in range. Correction minimum The lower or minimum value of the user\u2019s correction range, which is 90 mg/dL in the figure. Correction maximum The upper or maximum value of the user\u2019s correction range, which is 120 mg/dL in the figure. Correction target The correction target is the average value of the correction range. In the overview figure, this is 105 mg/dL given that the correction minimum is 90 mg/dL and the correction maximum is 120 mg/dL. Predicted blood glucose Loop makes a prediction of blood glucose values out for a length of time equal to your insulin action duration. The predicted blood glucose is the basis for how Loop makes its insulin delivery recommendations and actions. Eventual blood glucose The last value of the predicted glucose curve, in other words the very last blood glucose predicted at the end of your insulin action duration. In the figure above, this is 85 mg/dL. Minimum predicted blood glucose The lowest blood glucose value at any point in time within the prediction. In the figure above, this is 77 mg/dL. Delta The delta is the difference between the eventual blood glucose and the correction target. In the overview figure, the eventual blood glucose is 85 mg/dL and the correction target is 105 mg/dL, which means that the delta is  -20 mg/dL. Suspend Threshold The suspend threshold is a safety feature of the Loop algorithm. If any predicted blood glucose is below this threshold, the Loop algorithm will issue a temporary basal rate of 0 CGM data Blood glucose readings made by a continuous glucose monitor. Insulin sensitivity factor A configuration value that provides an estimate of how much blood glucose will drop given a unit of insulin. Active insulin Active insulin, often referred to as Insulin-on-Board (IOB), is the remaining amount of insulin activity from boluses and temporary basal rates relative to a user\u2019s scheduled basal rates. More specifically, it is the total amount of insulin activity due to all bolus and basal insulin delivered within the last N hours, where N is determined by the insulin activity duration. The amount of \u201cactive\u201d insulin depends upon the insulin activity curve, and also accounts for the insulin withheld via basal suspensions. As such, it is possible that the active insulin can be negative. Negative active insulin will result in an increase in predicted blood glucose. The active insulin displayed in Loop's main display does not reflect the currently enacted temporary basal rate, as that basal rate may be canceled or modified before completion over the next 30 minutes. In others words, Loop doesn't count chickens before the eggs hatch...insulin delivery must be confirmed before being added to the active insulin reporting."},{"location":"operation/algorithm/overview/#algorithm-section-menu","title":"Algorithm Section Menu","text":"<ul> <li>Algorithm Overview<ul> <li>Bolus Recommendations</li> <li>Blood Glucose Prediction</li> <li>Temp Basal Adjustments</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"operation/algorithm/prediction/","title":"Glucose Prediction","text":""},{"location":"operation/algorithm/prediction/#blood-glucose-prediction","title":"Blood Glucose Prediction","text":"<p>Loop uses an algorithm to maintain blood glucose in a correction range by predicting the contributions from four individual effects (insulin, carbohydrates, retrospective correction, and blood glucose momentum) at any time t to recommend temporary basal rate corrections and boluses.</p> \\[ BG[t] = Insulin[t] + Carb[t] + RetrospectiveCorrection[t] + Momentum[t] \\] <p>Note that the Momemtum term does not just add to the other effects as implied in the simple formular above; it is blended with the other terms as described in more detail in the Momemtum section below).</p> <p>You can see the individual contributions of these effects by tapping on the predicted blood glucose chart on Loop's status screen.

It's not a hard concept...basically how a battery dies over time as it is used or sits in a drawer.  More technically said, a battery discharge curve is the measure of volts that a battery puts out over time.  Batteries start at a higher voltage output and slowly that voltage output degrades over time (or use) until the battery no longer provides enough \"ummph\" to keep the electronic gadget going.  BUT, alkaline batteries and lithium batteries have different discharge curves due to the chemistry inside them, and the curves can be slightly different depending on the environment (temperature) and battery manufacturer.</p> <p>Alkaline batteries have a relatively steady voltage drop over time, as shown below.  Notice the shape of the curve has a significant amount of time in the 1.3 to 1.2 volts range, and a relatively smooth decline to about 1.2 volts.</p> <p></p> <p>Lithium batteries have a much steadier voltage output over time, as shown below.  Notice how the shape of the curve is relatively flat for a large portion of the battery life before suddenly off around 1.3 volts.</p> <p></p> <p>What does the above information mean in terms of Looping?  A lithium battery at 1.3v is going to have a much quicker time to death than an alkaline battery sitting at 1.3v.  You might only get a couple of hours of looping left when a lithium battery is at 1.3v, but an alkaline battery at 1.3v might go for several more days.  So when we talk about setting alarm levels in either system, your battery type is an important consideration.</p>"},{"location":"operation/features/battery/#medtronic-pump-battery-level-indicator","title":"Medtronic Pump Battery Level Indicator","text":"<p>If you read Medtronic's literature, it will tell you to use Energizer alkaline batteries in their pumps.  Why would that be?  Hint: the answer doesn't mean that Duracell batteries are inherently worse than Energizer or that lithium batteries won't work in Medtronic pumps.</p> <p>The answer is all about the accuracy of their little pump battery level indicator on their pump's screen.  Medtronic calibrated their pump battery level indicator to:</p> <ul> <li>Energizer alkaline batteries</li> <li>Normal (non-Loop) uses</li> <li>Temperatures between 37\u00b0F (3\u00b0C) to 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C).</li> </ul> <p>In other words, Medtronic ran experiments to see exactly how long an Energizer alkaline battery will last in normal pump use and made their own discharge curve.  They programmed their pump battery level indicator to change from 4 bars to 3 bars to 2 bars to 1 bar based on that particular discharge curve.</p> <p>However, Loop users are slightly more demanding on the pump's battery/voltage than simply delivering insulin.  We are also asking for the pump to perform radio communications, in addition to delivering insulin.  Those radio communications need a slightly higher voltage than the typical \"normal\" pump use.  So while a non-Looper might be ok running their pump until a voltage of about 1.12 for insulin delivery, radio communications might stop at a voltage output of about 1.17.  If you experiment with your Looping pump, you'll find Loop will turn red from failed pump comms before the pump actually fails at insulin delivery.  This difference between \"failure\" voltages needs to be considered when determining how much useful battery life is left for a pump battery.</p> <p>In summary, that little pump battery indicator on the Medtronic pump screen is ONLY useful if you are:</p> <ul> <li>not using the pump for Looping,</li> <li>using Energizer alkaline batteries, and</li> <li>in the temperature environment similar to their testing.</li> </ul> <p>Loop users should not rely on their Medtronic pump screen's pump battery indicator, and instead use the Loop's pump battery level indicator.</p>"},{"location":"operation/features/battery/#loops-pump-battery-level-indicator","title":"Loop's Pump Battery Level Indicator","text":"<p>Keeping the information about battery discharge curves in mind, Loop developers tested various battery brands and types to develop discharge curves for Loop users.

If however you add a setting of <code>PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS</code> to <code>true</code>, you will receive pump battery notifications according to the levels shown in the parenthesis above.  For example, your x23 pump is reporting its levels in percent, therefore you'd receive a yellow warning alarm at 30% and an urgent red alarm at 20%.  Your x22 pump however is reporting its levels at voltage readings, therefore you'd receive a warning yellow alarm at 1.35v and an urgent red alarm at 1.30v.</p> <p>Are the default NS alarm levels going to work for you?  The answer depends on what type of battery level you are using, what model pump you are using, and how much advance notification you want to receive before needing to change a pump battery.  There is a bit of personal preference and experimentation to finding what works for you.</p> <p>For x22 or x15 pump users, the NS alert settings that may need to be adjusted are the ones based on voltage.</p> <p>Generally speaking, for a x22 or x15 pump using alkaline batteries, the default NS alarm levels will be too early to be useful and lead you to change out your battery too frequently.  Alkaline batteries can go to low 1.2s or high 1.1s before Looping starts to have communication problems.  How much lower than the default voltage 1.35/1.30 alarm levels you want to go will depend on how far in advance you want to be warned about an upcoming battery change.</p> <p>If however, you are using a x22 or x15 pump with lithium batteries, the default 1.35v/1.30v alarm levels may be completely appropriate.  Remember how the lithium battery curves at the start of this discussion died off quickly around 1.3v?  You won't get hardly any heads-up notice for a lithium battery if you set the alarm below 1.3v.</p> <p>For x23 or x54 pump users, the NS alert settings that may need to be adjusted are the ones based on percentage settings.</p> <p>Alkaline and lithium batteries should have automatically had their percentage-remaining based on the correct battery type in your Loop settings.

For example, after tracking pump battery life on my 723 using energizer batteries lithium batteries for the last several months, I know that we get about 15 days plus a handful of hours.  The amount of hours more beyond 15 days varies depending on how much we've interacted with the pump buttons directly, whether we've looped the full 15-days solid, and if the pump has been in extreme weather (cold weather can sap pump battery life).

On the line below your original entry, Loop will also start tracking your food entry assuming a 1.5 times longer carb absorption time.  This helps Loop track carbs that may actually be absorbing longer than you expected (part of that whole dynamic carb absorption modeling).  Loop will be updating that value of \"observed\" carb absorption time as well as absorbed carbs as your meal goes on.</p> <p>So how can we use this information to make our Looping experience better?  The answer is probably best illustrated using a real-world example.  Chinese food...in fact, this Chinese dish.  General Tso's chicken.  As you can see in the recipe, loads of fast carbs with ingredients like hoisin sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch.  But also slower carbs like chicken.  Rice can be a difficult one because, for us, it acts fast but also seems to have a long tail.</p> <p></p> <p>It was a busy day and I really didn't want to count carbs.  Ok, even on the slow days I don't want to count carbs.  I just eyeballed the bowl of food and guessed.  As I entered the food in originally, I was still trying to come up with a good guess on the ratio of fast:slow carbs but kid was in a hurry to eat.  My initial guess around 3:30 pm was 70g of carbs at 5 hours absorption (note: it gets edited to 80g in a little bit), we bolused for that and she started to eat.  About 10 minutes later, I decided to add 10g of fast-acting carbs at 1-hour absorption to help with the sauce's speedy carbs.</p> <p></p> <p>Watching what was going on a little later...glucose levels were rising at a decent clip and I had a feeling I really didn't cover things super well...so I edited the original 70g entry, adding 10g and making it 80g instead.  (That's why there is a 2U bolus around 4:20 pm.)  And of course, around 5:40 pm there was a little bit of nibbling on the leftovers as we put them into the fridge.  We gave 10g for that.  Glucose levels climbed a bit more, not surprising given how we were underestimating fast carbs at this point...but still not so bad at 180 peak glucose.  (Anna gave 2 units of correction at the peak because there was dessert coming later that night and she wanted to be ready for it without too much pre-bolus.)</p> <p></p> <p>So, how can I use the \"Glucose Change\"  graph to make this meal better?  I can look at the observed carb information and the observed carb entry Loop has recorded to adjust my insulin bolusing the next time we eat this meal.</p> <p>For example, the biggest weakness I had in this (and suspected it even as I did the initial bolus) was that I underestimated the sauce's fast carbs.  I can see this in the observed carb absorption graph having the early green peaks after the meal, and in the way that the observed carb distribution was more like 7:2 vs my original guess of 8:1 (slow:fast carbs).  Overall, it appears that I guess on overall carb content pretty closely (90g vs. 89g observed).  Next time we have General Tso's chicken, I will likely bolus it as 70g at 5 hours and 20g at 2 hours.</p> <p></p> <p>Check Carbohydrates Page</p> <p>Remember to check your Carbohydrates page at the end of a meal's absorption.  By checking in on the meal's observed behaviors, you'll have a good starting point to fine-tuning any new or unknown carb breakdown.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Remember this conversation is assuming you have basals fairly well set and are not sick.  If other factors could be significantly causing your glucose levels to swing that Loop doesn't know about (bad sites, illness, or basal rates that need to be adjusted), they may be attributed in part to ICE when they really aren't food-related.  In those cases, address the underlying cause and then use the Carbohydrates page when you've come back to \"normal\".</p>"},{"location":"operation/features/notifications/","title":"Loop Notifications","text":""},{"location":"operation/features/notifications/#loop-notifications","title":"Loop Notifications","text":"<p>Loop provides discrete notifications on the iPhone and Watch which will appear on the (locked) screen and vibrate, depending on your notification settings of Loop.</p>"},{"location":"operation/features/notifications/#loop-alert-unable-to-reach-pump","title":"Loop Alert - Unable to Reach Pump","text":"<p>With Loop 3, there is a new modal alert that halts all Loop activity until pump communication can be restored.</p> <p></p> <p>When you tap on the Learn More button, another screen appears.

The information in this video is still generally useful with the last half focused on automatic-bolus - the automatic-bolus dosing strategy has now been incorporated into Loop <code>main</code> branch. Loop has moved on to using only one stable branch (<code>main</code>), with <code>dev</code> suggested for developers/testers.</p>"},{"location":"version/development/#loop-github-information","title":"<code>Loop</code> GitHub Information","text":"<p>Loop developers own an account in GitHub called LoopKit.  Within that account, the developers have several <code>repositories</code> that support Loop in particular. A repository\u200b is like a book...let's think of it like a cookbook for now. Within the <code>LoopKit</code> account, there are <code>repositories</code> for Loop\u200b itself, LoopDocs, and various other supporting \"frameworks\" that are helper \u200brepositories\u200b for Loop to build correctly. For example, Loop's \u200brepository\u200b has a lot of info about the app itself; the outward-facing things that you interact with. How information is put to you and taken in from you...that's in Loop <code>repository</code> code. But, there's more than just a user interface for Loop. Loop has to do a lot of complex work like Bluetooth communications, algorithm math, pump communications, etc. The Loop app has help from frameworks to do those other parts. <code>CGMBLEkit</code>\u00a0 for some of the transmitter parts of Loop, <code>RileyLink_ios</code> for the pump managers (talking to the pumps and decoding their information), <code>LoopKit</code> for the algorithm about carbs and insulin curves, etc.</p> <p>When you build Loop, in the background, Loop pulls those other frameworks (7 in total) into the build process using <code>Carthage</code>.  <code>Carthage</code>\u00a0  is like a personal shopper. You give it a shopping list (the cart file in Loop code is that shopping list) and it goes and fetches that for you during the build process. Sometimes your computer has an old shopping list...and that can cause build errors. Hence the <code>carthage update</code> fix in the Build Errors page...that command updates the shopping list to get the right versions of those frameworks.</p> <p></p> <p>Anyways...so now you know about the general structure of Loop and LoopKit in GitHub. Now we can discuss Loop itself a little deeper.</p> <p>So let's imagine Loop as a cookbook. The developers are the authors/chefs of the recipes (code) in the cookbook. The authors spend countless hours testing new recipes, taste testing, and documenting improvements. They send the drafts to the editor, who makes suggestions and eventually, the cookbook is finalized. There are no grammar issues, and no typos, the photos are beautiful and the recipes are yummy. They publish the book and you see a gorgeous final product on the shelves. That is called a release\u200b, and it is the <code>main</code> branch. This book has been well-tested and is super stable. Every time you cook with those recipes, you know exactly what you're getting and lots of people have had a chance before you to make sure that it all tastes good. The <code>main</code> branch is stable and tested.</p> <p>But then...the chefs/developers go on a trip. They are inspired by new cuisine and want to add new recipes to the old cookbook. (Things like Omnipod\u200b support and the overrides are new \"recipes\" that were developed since the last <code>main</code> release, for example.) But, the process of developing a recipe is arduous. There was a lot of trial and error involved. Lots of tweaking ingredients (code). The editors try out the new recipes and offer feedback (similar to the Issues List on GitHub). While the recipes are being developed, they have a version of the old cookbook that gets marked up...edited in pencil a lot. Scribbles and notes in the side. Revisions happen frequently because that's what testing new recipes is all about. These marked-up versions of the cookbook are called the <code>dev</code> branch. Short for \"development\" branch. Like the name sounds...this is where new developments are happening, new recipes, and tweaks.</p> <p>After much testing and tweaking, eventually, the recipes get the flavors right (bugs in code are squashed) and enough people have provided feedback and careful observations of results...that the book goes to the publishing house for the next printing. The cookbook is republished with an updated edition number and new recipes are highlighted. When this happens in Loop,  Loop's <code>main</code> branch is updated with the new features coming from <code>dev</code> (aka, the <code>dev</code> branch is merged into the <code>main</code> branch). When that happens, the <code>main</code> branch gets another <code>release</code> version. At this point, <code>dev</code> and <code>main</code> are identical. They remain so until the development team for Loop\u00a0 starts working on the next batch of improvements, which could be in the next hour or even days later, but then the cycle starts again.  The developers will start editing the code again and dropping those edits in the <code>dev</code> branch for further development.</p>"},{"location":"version/development/#whats-going-on-in-the-dev-branch","title":"What's going on in the <code>dev</code> branch?","text":"<p>The <code>dev</code> branch, currently v3.5.0, is where the next version of Loop is being developed and tested.</p> <p>If you choose to build Loop using a <code>dev</code> branch, you need to be aware that the <code>dev</code> branch may update code frequently and unannounced in the traditional sense that most users in the  Looped group or Instagram would see.

And they are not plain English-friendly.</p>"},{"location":"version/loopworkspace/#what-is-loopworkspace","title":"What is LoopWorkspace?","text":"<p>There is more information in Loop Development that is not repeated here.</p> <p>The important fact for this discussion on LoopWorkspace is that Loop developers own an account in GitHub called <code>LoopKit</code>.  Within that account, the developers have several <code>repositories</code> that support Loop in particular. A <code>repository</code> is like a book...let's think of it like a cookbook for now. Within the <code>LoopKit</code> account, there are repositories for Loop itself, LoopDocs, and various other supporting \"frameworks\" that are helper repositories for Loop to build correctly. For example, Loop's repo has a lot of info about the app itself; and the outward-facing things that you interact with. How information is put to you and taken in from you...that's in Loop <code>repository</code> code. But, there's more than just a user interface for Loop. Loop has to do a lot of complex work like Bluetooth communications, algorithm math, pump communications, etc. The Loop app has help from frameworks to do those other parts. <code>CGMBLEkit</code> for some of the transmitter parts of Loop, <code>RileyLink_ios</code> for the pump managers (talking to the pumps and decoding their information), LoopKit for the algorithm about carbs and insulin curves, etc.</p> <p>When you build Loop from <code>LoopWorkspace</code>, each of those repositories is downloaded to your computer.  This is slower than the old zip-download as far as downloading Loop - but it is much faster when you build Loop because all the files are already on your computer.</p> <p><code>LoopWorkspace</code> uses submodules to define how the frameworks are coordinated for building. The graphic below shows the dev branch at a particular point in time.  The precise version, or commit, of each submodule is defined by 7-character hexadecimal codes (look up SHA-1) with the repository for each submodule defined in a text file called <code>.gitmodules</code>.</p> <ul> <li>Several key <code>git</code> and other operating system commands will be provided later to assist you</li> <li>These commands will not be explained in detail</li> <li>If you want to know more, search the internet for documentation</li> <li>Often a series of commands is shown on one line, separated by semicolons</li> </ul> <p>The commit identifier for each submodule is important because that repository can be modified after things are set up and working with Loop.

And, you'd want to make sure you specify the branch that the new feature is on, too. DeveloperBob should usually include the branch name when he posts/shares.

You can't clone multiple \"LoopWorkspaces\" into the exact same home directory (because they will have the same name), so you may want to create a subdirectory to put them in. Like you could make a folder called \"DeveloperBob\" and then move into that directory in Terminal before you clone DeveloperBob's LoopWorkspace.</p> <p>How would you do that? Simple <code>cd &amp;&amp; mkdir DeveloperBob</code> would make the new folder in your home directory. And then <code>cd DeveloperBob</code> would move your Terminal app to be working inside the new DeveloperBob folder. So if you wanted to clone DeveloperBob's LoopWorkspace, that would be a good way to keep track of where the code came from.</p> <p>If you ever get in doubt and can't remember where your code was cloned from, you can <code>cd LoopWorkspace</code> to get into the directory and then use <code>git remote -v</code> to tell you where it came from.</p>"},{"location":"version/loopworkspace/#pushing-commits-from-loopworkspace","title":"Pushing commits from LoopWorkspace","text":"<p>So you've got a great idea for a new feature, made those changes to your LoopWorkspace, and want to get them into GitHub. Awesome!</p> <p>To understand how to do this, we'll need to understand a bit more about how git keeps track of changes. In git, developers can have different \"branches\" (see What are Git Branches? on the Loop Development page for more details about what a branch is). There are two different types of branches: remote and local. If you were to fork Loop on GitHub, then the branches that you can see on GitHub are \"remote\" branches - they're hosted on the GitHub server. On the other hand, you can also create \"local\" branches that are stored directly on your computer by \"checking out\" the remote branch. You'll need to \"commit\" your changes to the local branch, and then \"push\" those changes to the remote branch in order to be able to see them in GitHub. There are specific commands that you can type into the command line to do all of these actions, but I'm not going to go into detail because there are different ways and everyone has their own preference.</p> <p>It's a little easier to think about this with an analogy. Let's say you're working at a company that's creating a cookbook. There's a centralized, production-ready version of the cookbook on their website that all the employees can view. Think of the website version of this cookbook as being like the remote branch. You're assigned to change the pancake recipe in the cookbook. Since the company doesn't want employees to make changes directly to the version of the cookbook that the customers see, you need to make a copy of it on your computer so you can make your changes to the pancake recipe. When you make the personal copy on your computer, it's like \"checking out\" the remote branch. Your copy is like the local branch - you can make whatever changes you want without having to worry about customers accidentally seeing them. When you make an important change to the recipe (like adding a photo or changing the ingredients), you might want to make a note in the edit history so that you can go back to that version of the recipe in case you accidentally make unintended changes - those notes you make would be \"commits\". Once you're happy with the recipe, you'll add it back into the production version of the cookbook on the website, which is similar to what you're doing when you \"push\" your changes.</p> <p>Where do the submodules fit in? Each submodule is actually a branch, so when you make changes to multiple submodules, you'll need to commit those changes to their respective branches. Let's say you've made changes to Loop and LoopKit. You'll need to go into Loop and commit and push the changes, then go into LoopKit and commit and push the changes.</p> <p>There are a few different ways to keep track of all these different branches. Some people like using the command line (which is what you're using when you do commands like <code>git clone</code>) because it's very customizable and has the largest variety of commands. Others like to use graphical Git editors, which make it easier to see changes and be able to do a variety of common actions (like cloning, committing, and pushing) with the push of a button. Everyone has their own preferences, but some methods that Loop contributors have used in the past include the command line, Gitkraken, and SourceTree.</p>"},{"location":"version/overview-version/","title":"Version Overview","text":""},{"location":"version/overview-version/#version-overview","title":"Version Overview","text":"<p>The Version tab of LoopDocs contains information about releases (versions), code customization and development.</p> <p>Map to this section:</p> <ul> <li>Releases<ul> <li>Description of the current released version of the Loop app including when it was released</li> <li>Reverse chronology of earlier releases</li> </ul> </li> <li>Information needed to Personalize (Customize) your app (regardless of build method)<ul> <li>Custom Edits</li> <li>Build-Time Flag</li> </ul> </li> <li>Simulator Build<ul> <li>Considerations when using a simulator</li> </ul> </li> <li>Loop Development<ul> <li>Description of the development process for Loop</li> <li>Information you need if you want to participate</li> </ul> </li> <li>Build Dev<ul> <li>Considerations when using the dev branch</li> <li>Links to the two build methods</li> </ul> </li> <li>LoopWorkspace<ul> <li>If you are interested in development, this page goes into more detail</li> <li>The primary focus is on techniques for using the <code>git</code> tool</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Older Loop release information is kept for historical reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Older Releases:     Loop 2 Releases</li> </ul>"},{"location":"version/releases-version2/","title":"Loop 2 and Older","text":""},{"location":"version/releases-version2/#compatibility-between-versions-2-and-3","title":"Compatibility between Versions 2 and 3","text":"<p>If you are running a much older version of the Loop app, be aware:</p> <ul> <li>You can build Loop 3 over older versions of Loop and maintain therapy settings as well as your configuration for CGM and pump (including a pod)</li> <li>You can build Loop 3 using a browser on any computer (no Mac required) with Build with Browser</li> <li>Your phone must be running at least iOS 15.1 (although some people report they needed newer iOS than that when building with GitHub Browser Build)</li> </ul> <p>Loop 3 is NOT backwards compatible.\u00a0Once you build Loop 3 or later on your phone, you cannot return to Loop 2.2.x or FreeAPS without some additional work.</p> <ul> <li>Be prepared to enter all your settings again and start a new pod</li> <li>If you use Loop Follow, you do not need to delete Loop Follow</li> <li>When downgrading to an older version of Loop from Loop 3, you have to delete all apps with a shared app group ID<ul> <li>For more information, click on Remove Apps with Shared App Group</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"version/releases-version2/#loop-2-version-history","title":"Loop 2 Version History","text":""},{"location":"version/releases-version2/#loop-v229","title":"Loop v2.2.9","text":"<p>This release updates Loop to handle Dexcom Share server changes for how glucose trend is parsed.

After you add your CGM transmitter ID, go back into the CGM info and you'll see a new slider called \"Upload Readings.\"  Technically, Loop's dev branch had that feature for a hot minute before Loop v2.0 was released...but for almost everyone this will be a brand new feature they haven't had before. This feature can help if/when Dexcom's Share servers ever go through another large outage like we had before. If that happens, you can turn on the \"Upload Readings\" switch and your CGM data will now be in Nightscout even without Share servers working properly. Good practice would be to temporarily disable your Share bridge in Nightscout while Loop is responsible for CGM uploading so that you don't get duplicate data. You can disable Share bridge by logging into your Heroku account, going to the Settings tab, clicking on \"reveal config vars\" and then deleting the word \"bridge\" from the ENABLE line.</p>"},{"location":"version/releases-version2/#a-fix-for-settings-loss","title":"A fix for settings loss","text":"<p>iOS 13 brought about a quirky little bug where you could suddenly lose settings in Loop.

What this means is that food absorption was modeled as a flat, even effect (like the straight grey graph that you'll see in the Insulin Counteraction Effects chart after you added a carb entry. But looking at large groups of meals' datasets (and supported by personal, anecdotal experiences), food really has a bit more of a non-linear absorption. Meaning, we usually see more of a food impact up-front than the old carb model in Loop predicted.</p> <p>What did that mismatch mean for us if the model predicts a linear absorption, but the meal actually behaves differently?</p> <ol> <li>Bolusing: You've probably seen smaller upfront boluses for meals than you would have preferred. This is because the insulin was predicted to over-power the linear (slower) carb model soon after a bolus is given.</li> <li>Early low temp basals: You've also probably seen a tendency to have early zero basal or low basals set by Loop for the first 30-60 minutes after a meal bolus if you don't have a significant blood glucose spike immediately after the carb entry. This might have been even more obvious for those of you who are regularly waiting to eat after a bolus, too.</li> </ol> <p>With a non-linear absorption model, the carb absorption will more closely match observed blood glucose impacts we've seen after meals. And when the model is more closely matching actual experience, that means the predicted blood glucose curves will do a better job at providing more upfront bolus and not having the tendency to have overly conservative temp basals soon after a meal.</p>"},{"location":"version/releases-version2/#overrides-introduced","title":"Overrides Introduced","text":"<p>Loop v2.0 marks the first time Loop master branch has overrides included.
