This is critical. If you are updating your Loop app, please review the iOS driven requirements for minimum version of macOS and Xcode.</p> </li> <li> <p>Did you check your Apple developer account for new license agreement? Periodically, Apple will release a new developer license agreement that you need to sign before you can build new apps. You will get a build failure if there is a pending license agreement to sign. Login to your Apple developer account to check if there's a new license agreement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you have a new computer, never used to build Loop? Did you Add Apple ID to Xcode?</p> </li> <li> <p>Did you reboot, i.e., restart, your computer after updating Xcode?

This costs nothing for the buyer, but the seller will lose 2.95% of the sale to PayPal fees. PayPal offers some protection for both buyer and seller in the event of fraud.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Ask for photos of the pump. Check to make sure the serial number of the pump on the backside matches the serial number of the pump showing in the display menu. Ask for a short video of the pump, or at least a photo of the pump turned on, so that you can see the pump's firmware and model number. Cracks and some wear on these pumps are expected. These pumps are not usually free of marks. Many people are successfully looping on pumps that have cracks and rub marks, but you may want to ask if you are concerned about any you see in photos.</p> </li> <li> <p>Beware if the bottom of the reservoir/motor sleeve has the drive support cap pushed out, as shown here. Those pumps will generally not work (or only work intermittently), however some people have successfully repaired those pumps as shown in that link. Just be aware that it should be checked in advance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repairs to cracks or missing bits of plastic on battery cap area and reservoir caps are possible and not very difficult in most situations. You can read more about how to repair those here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask for shipping that includes a tracking number. USPS Priority Mail's smallest box is a great option.  It's only $7.20 domestically in the US and includes tracking. Ask the seller to add a small bit of packing protection such as bubble wrap around the pump to keep it safe during shipping. Make sure you get a tracking number within a reasonable period of time after you have paid.  </p> </li> </ul> <p>Red flags that may indicate a scam:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Asking for payment through \"friends and family\" on PayPal, especially if you don't know the person or have any solid references for them. Paying in that way offers you no buyer protection. It's just like giving the seller cash, so you had better trust the seller.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Offering an \"almost new\" pump is a big red flag. These pumps should be at least 5-years-old by now. Do you really think a 5 year old pump should be unused and sitting in shrink wrap at this point? This seems highly suspicious. There are some out there, but they are very infrequent.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Not able to provide new pictures of the pump when requested. Sure they posted some pictures with the ad, but what if they just downloaded them from other people's ads? The seller should be able to furnish a couple of \"new\" photos at your request. A good one to ask for is the battery and reservoir tops so you can see the condition of those.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"build/pump/#pump-supplies","title":"Pump Supplies","text":"<p>Medtronic will not typically sell pump supplies directly to customers who have not previously purchased a registered Medtronic pump.

The biggest external influences are (1) body-blocking and (2) \"noisy\" environments. The human body is a lot of water, and water is an excellent blocker of wireless communication. So, sleeping on a pod and smothering it entirely with your body can decrease the ability of the device to communicate with the pod. Environments with a high concentration of wireless signals can also interfere with device communications and make closer proximity a benefit. Where might those kinds of situations happen? Concerts, conferences, and sporting arenas are pretty prone to interference.</p> <p>Many people keep their device on the same side of their body as their pump during the day. They use a pocket, carabiner, lanyard, SPIbelt - the options are endless.

The messages in the table are in order of priority. For example, a <code>No Recent Glucose</code> message is displayed even when an <code>Override</code> is active.</p> <p>Bolus In Progress</p> <p>The bolus messages are displayed with the highest priority:</p> <ul> <li>If another message is shown when a bolus starts, the bolus message is displayed instead</li> <li>To return to the other message, such as Override or <code>No Recent Glucose</code>, you must either wait for the bolus to complete or cancel the bolus by tapping on the <code>Status Row</code></li> <li>To ensure you do not accidentally cancel a bolus, keep the phone locked when not in use</li> </ul> Status Row / Meaning When the user issues a manual bolus through the app, a <code>Starting Bolus</code> information message is displayed. Tapping on this message has no action.As soon as the app issues a command to the pump (or sends it to the RileyLink to be delivered to the pump), the bolus in progress message appears. As soon as a bolus is started, from either a manual command or an automatic bolus, the bolus in progress message is displayed. Tapping on the <code>Status Row</code> causes the app to attempt to cancel the bolus. The app can only cancel a bolus if communication is active between the app and the pump.The message says <code>Bolused</code>value<code>of</code>total<code>U</code>. The value is based on a timer, so it is possible for an occlusion or other fault to occur while the app indicates bolus is in progress.In case of a fault, the user can tap on the pump icon to force a new pump status reading. For the case of pods, this allows you to  silence a screaming pod quickly. Once the app communicates with the pump, the actual delivery status will be updated. If the user taps on the bolus in progress message in the <code>Status Row</code>, the message changes to Canceling Bolus. Tapping on this message has no action. As soon the app determines that the pump is suspended, the <code>Insulin Suspended, Tap to Resume</code> message is displayed. Tapping on the <code>Status Row</code> resumes scheduled basal delivery if communication is active between the app and the pump.Medtronic pump users who suspend directly on the pump will notice a delay before this message is displayed. It is best to use the app Pump Settings screen to suspend the pump. If a higher priority message is not displayed in the <code>Status Row</code> and the glucose value is stale (more than 15 minutes old), the <code>No Recent Glucose, Tap to Add</code> message is displayed. Tapping on the <code>Status Row</code> opens the Manual Bolus screen for entry of a Fingerstick Glucose. Note that if you choose not to accept a recommended bolus on this screen but you want to save the Fingerstick value, you need to tap the Bolus line to force it to 0 U and then tap <code>Save Without Bolusing</code>. However, be aware that, in Closed Loop mode, the app will use that glucose value for the next 15 minutes and may adjust insulin delivery accordingly. If a higher priority message is not displayed in the <code>Status Row</code> and an override is active, the override symbol and name, along with the time at which the override expires, is displayed. Tapping on the <code>Status Row</code> opens the screen for that particular override to enable the user to edit the override. Note that any changes made to that override are applied just to the current session. If you want the override permanently modified, refer to the Overrides instructions. If a higher priority message is not displayed in the <code>Status Row</code> and the Pre-Meal Range is active in the toolbar, the <code>Pre-meal Preset, until time stamp</code> is displayed. Tapping on the status row has no effect for this message.New with Loop 3: The Pre-Meal Preset can be engaged with an Override.

(Nightscout\u00a0 also integrates with other open-source hybrid closed loop systems such as OpenAPS, AndroidAPS and iAPS. \u00a0LoopDocs\u00a0 focuses on \u00a0Loop.)</p> <p>When integrated with \u00a0Loop, \u00a0Nightscout\u00a0 provides monitoring of \u00a0Loop\u00a0 activities such as viewing history of glucose, carbs, boluses, temp basals and overrides; troubleshooting \u00a0Loop\u00a0 errors; and provides extensive reports for analyzing data trends and patterns. These reports assist when \u00a0Loop Therapy Settings\u00a0 need to be adjusted.</p> <p>For caregivers, \u00a0Nightscout\u00a0 enables remote monitoring and even the ability to issue remote commands through \u00a0Nightscout\u00a0 when both \u00a0Loop\u00a0 and \u00a0Nightscout\u00a0 are properly configured.

Note that Loop never issues a bolus command automatically while using the default Temp Basal dosing strategy; all boluses are initiated by the user unless the automatic bolus dosing strategy is enabled.

As described above, the Loop algorithm computes the recommended bolus such that predicted glucose will not dip below the suspend threshold. This may result in future blood glucose levels predicted above correction range, but will prevent a hypoglycemia event shortly after the meal (as it sometimes occurs for people giving a \"pizza bolus\" in traditional pump therapy). Loop will then later make corrections by issuing higher temporary basals or automatic boluses.

The insulin activity duration is 6 hours for Loop's rapid-acting and ultra-rapid insulin models. Correction range The correction range is the blood glucose range Loop uses to determine corrective actions (e.g., between 90 and 120 mg/dL in the figure). NOTE: Loop\u2019s correction range is a user setting and should not be confused with the target range, typically 70-180 mg/dL, used for the purpose of calculating the percent time in range. Correction minimum The lower or minimum value of the user\u2019s correction range, which is 90 mg/dL in the figure. Correction maximum The upper or maximum value of the user\u2019s correction range, which is 120 mg/dL in the figure. Correction target The correction target is the average value of the correction range. In the overview figure, this is 105 mg/dL given that the correction minimum is 90 mg/dL and the correction maximum is 120 mg/dL. Predicted blood glucose Loop makes a prediction of blood glucose values out for a length of time equal to your insulin action duration. The predicted blood glucose is the basis for how Loop makes its insulin delivery recommendations and actions. Eventual blood glucose The last value of the predicted glucose curve, in other words the very last blood glucose predicted at the end of your insulin action duration. In the figure above, this is 85 mg/dL. Minimum predicted blood glucose The lowest blood glucose value at any point in time within the prediction. In the figure above, this is 77 mg/dL. Delta The delta is the difference between the eventual blood glucose and the correction target. In the overview figure, the eventual blood glucose is 85 mg/dL and the correction target is 105 mg/dL, which means that the delta is  -20 mg/dL. Suspend Threshold The suspend threshold is a safety feature of the Loop algorithm. If any predicted blood glucose is below this threshold, the Loop algorithm will issue a temporary basal rate of 0 CGM data Blood glucose readings made by a continuous glucose monitor. Insulin sensitivity factor A configuration value that provides an estimate of how much blood glucose will drop given a unit of insulin. Active insulin Active insulin, often referred to as Insulin-on-Board (IOB), is the remaining amount of insulin activity from boluses and temporary basal rates relative to a user\u2019s scheduled basal rates. More specifically, it is the total amount of insulin activity due to all bolus and basal insulin delivered within the last N hours, where N is determined by the insulin activity duration. The amount of \u201cactive\u201d insulin depends upon the insulin activity curve, and also accounts for the insulin withheld via basal suspensions. As such, it is possible that the active insulin can be negative. Negative active insulin will result in an increase in predicted blood glucose. The active insulin displayed in Loop's main display does not reflect the currently enacted temporary basal rate, as that basal rate may be canceled or modified before completion over the next 30 minutes. In others words, Loop doesn't count chickens before the eggs hatch...insulin delivery must be confirmed before being added to the active insulin reporting."},{"location":"operation/algorithm/overview/#algorithm-section-menu","title":"Algorithm Section Menu","text":"<ul> <li>Algorithm Overview<ul> <li>Bolus Recommendations</li> <li>Blood Glucose Prediction</li> <li>Temp Basal Adjustments</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"operation/algorithm/prediction/","title":"Glucose Prediction","text":""},{"location":"operation/algorithm/prediction/#blood-glucose-prediction","title":"Blood Glucose Prediction","text":"<p>Loop uses an algorithm to maintain blood glucose in a correction range by predicting the contributions from four individual effects (insulin, carbohydrates, retrospective correction, and blood glucose momentum) at any time t to recommend temporary basal rate corrections and boluses.</p> \\[ BG[t] = Insulin[t] + Carb[t] + RetrospectiveCorrection[t] + Momentum[t] \\] <p>Note that the Momemtum term does not just add to the other effects; it is actually more complicated (and also more challenging to describe in simple math terms).</p> <p>You can see the individual contributions of these effects by tapping on the predicted blood glucose chart on Loop's status screen.

It's not a hard concept...basically how a battery dies over time as it is used or sits in a drawer.  More technically said, a battery discharge curve is the measure of volts that a battery puts out over time.  Batteries start at a higher voltage output and slowly that voltage output degrades over time (or use) until the battery no longer provides enough \"ummph\" to keep the electronic gadget going.  BUT, alkaline batteries and lithium batteries have different discharge curves due to the chemistry inside them, and the curves can be slightly different depending on the environment (temperature) and battery manufacturer.</p> <p>Alkaline batteries have a relatively steady voltage drop over time, as shown below.  Notice the shape of the curve has a significant amount of time in the 1.3 to 1.2 volts range, and a relatively smooth decline to about 1.2 volts.</p> <p></p> <p>Lithium batteries have a much steadier voltage output over time, as shown below.

A lithium battery at 1.3v is going to have a much quicker time to death than an alkaline battery sitting at 1.3v.  You might only get a couple of hours of looping left when a lithium battery is at 1.3v, but an alkaline battery at 1.3v might go for several more days.  So when we talk about setting alarm levels in either system, your battery type is an important consideration.</p>"},{"location":"operation/features/battery/#medtronic-pump-battery-level-indicator","title":"Medtronic Pump Battery Level Indicator","text":"<p>If you read Medtronic's literature, it will tell you to use Energizer alkaline batteries in their pumps.  Why would that be?  Hint: the answer doesn't mean that Duracell batteries are inherently worse than Energizer or that lithium batteries won't work in Medtronic pumps.</p> <p>The answer is all about the accuracy of their little pump battery level indicator on their pump's screen.  Medtronic calibrated their pump battery level indicator to:</p> <ul> <li>Energizer alkaline batteries</li> <li>Normal (non-Loop) uses</li> <li>Temperatures between 37\u00b0F (3\u00b0C) to 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C).</li> </ul> <p>In other words, Medtronic ran experiments to see exactly how long an Energizer alkaline battery will last in normal pump use and made their own discharge curve.  They programmed their pump battery level indicator to change from 4 bars to 3 bars to 2 bars to 1 bar based on that particular discharge curve.</p> <p>However, Loop users are slightly more demanding on the pump's battery/voltage than simply delivering insulin.  We are also asking for the pump to perform radio communications, in addition to delivering insulin.  Those radio communications need a slightly higher voltage than the typical \"normal\" pump use.  So while a non-Looper might be ok running their pump until a voltage of about 1.12 for insulin delivery, radio communications might stop at a voltage output of about 1.17.  If you experiment with your Looping pump, you'll find Loop will turn red from failed pump comms before the pump actually fails at insulin delivery.  This difference between \"failure\" voltages needs to be considered when determining how much useful battery life is left for a pump battery.</p> <p>In summary, that little pump battery indicator on the Medtronic pump screen is ONLY useful if you are:</p> <ul> <li>not using the pump for Looping,</li> <li>using Energizer alkaline batteries, and</li> <li>in the temperature environment similar to their testing.</li> </ul> <p>Loop users should not rely on their Medtronic pump screen's pump battery indicator, and instead use the Loop's pump battery level indicator.</p>"},{"location":"operation/features/battery/#loops-pump-battery-level-indicator","title":"Loop's Pump Battery Level Indicator","text":"<p>Keeping the information about battery discharge curves in mind, Loop developers tested various battery brands and types to develop discharge curves for Loop users.

This display is driven by a timer and logic on the phone. (Loop is not asking the pump repeatedly - \"are you done yet?\"). You may want to interrupt an uncertain bolus if it is large, evaluate status and then resume with a fresh bolus. Loop should update the status the next time it contacts the pump. It can determine whether that bolus actually went through or not and will update the screen.  Look at the Event History screen (accessed by tapping the Active Insulin or Insulin Delivery plots). Turn your phone to landscape orientation and you should see either \"Certain\" or \"Uncertain\" at the end of each Bolus record. (If you tap on the specific record, even more detail is displayed.)</p> <p>If an \"uncertain\" delivery is not resolved:</p> <ul> <li>Make sure the RileyLink compatible device is communicating properly</li> <li>You can try to turn off Bluetooth and then turn it back on again</li> <li>Quit the Loop app and restart it. (Note - this is different from a power cycle of the phone which remembers settings within an app that was running before the power cycle.)</li> </ul> <p>If that does not resolve the issue, please tap on Loop Settings, Issue Report and email it to yourself. Then post on Facebook or Zulipchat, explain what happened and say you have an Issue Report.

On the line below your original entry, Loop will also start tracking your food entry assuming a 1.5 times longer carb absorption time.  This helps Loop track carbs that may actually be absorbing longer than you expected (part of that whole dynamic carb absorption modeling).  Loop will be updating that value of \"observed\" carb absorption time as well as absorbed carbs as your meal goes on.</p> <p>So how can we use this information to make our Looping experience better?  The answer is probably best illustrated using a real-world example.  Chinese food...in fact, this Chinese dish.  General Tso's chicken.  As you can see in the recipe, loads of fast carbs with ingredients like hoisin sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch.  But also slower carbs like chicken.  Rice can be a difficult one because, for us, it acts fast but also seems to have a long tail.</p> <p></p> <p>It was a busy day and I really didn't want to count carbs.  Ok, even on the slow days I don't want to count carbs.  I just eyeballed the bowl of food and guessed.  As I entered the food in originally, I was still trying to come up with a good guess on the ratio of fast:slow carbs but kid was in a hurry to eat.  My initial guess around 3:30 pm was 70g of carbs at 5 hours absorption (note: it gets edited to 80g in a little bit), we bolused for that and she started to eat.  About 10 minutes later, I decided to add 10g of fast-acting carbs at 1-hour absorption to help with the sauce's speedy carbs.</p> <p></p> <p>Watching what was going on a little later...glucose levels were rising at a decent clip and I had a feeling I really didn't cover things super well...so I edited the original 70g entry, adding 10g and making it 80g instead.  (That's why there is a 2U bolus around 4:20 pm.)  And of course, around 5:40 pm there was a little bit of nibbling on the leftovers as we put them into the fridge.  We gave 10g for that.  Glucose levels climbed a bit more, not surprising given how we were underestimating fast carbs at this point...but still not so bad at 180 peak glucose.  (Anna gave 2 units of correction at the peak because there was dessert coming later that night and she wanted to be ready for it without too much pre-bolus.)</p> <p></p> <p>So, how can I use the \"Glucose Change\"  graph to make this meal better?  I can look at the observed carb information and the observed carb entry Loop has recorded to adjust my insulin bolusing the next time we eat this meal.</p> <p>For example, the biggest weakness I had in this (and suspected it even as I did the initial bolus) was that I underestimated the sauce's fast carbs.  I can see this in the observed carb absorption graph having the early green peaks after the meal, and in the way that the observed carb distribution was more like 7:2 vs my original guess of 8:1 (slow:fast carbs).  Overall, it appears that I guess on overall carb content pretty closely (90g vs. 89g observed).  Next time we have General Tso's chicken, I will likely bolus it as 70g at 5 hours and 20g at 2 hours.</p> <p></p> <p>Check Carbohydrates Page</p> <p>Remember to check your Carbohydrates page at the end of a meal's absorption.

Some will recover fine, others may not. Since you can't know in advance if you might lose the pod, it is important to have already exhausted other possibilities described above in Steps 1-4 to try pairing. Specifically, (1) attempting to pair several times using varied relative positions of the RileyLink and pod (2) trying the pairing again but in a different room/location that might have less wireless interference, and (3) verifying your RileyLink is connected and functioning correctly.</p> <p>For this next part, we want to make sure that the pod doesn't accidentally receive the deactivation command we are about to use. We want Loop to do the command...we just really don't want the pod to hear it. There are two ways we can keep the pod from hearing it, either (1) prevent the RileyLink from hearing Loop's command (and thus the command cannot reach the pod) or (2) prevent the pod from hearing the command from RileyLink. To accomplish our keep-the-pod-ignorant goal, you can try either option like so:</p> <ol> <li>Prevent RileyLink from hearing: Turn your RileyLink off temporarily at its physical switch. Some people worry about accidentally breaking their RileyLink switch, and if that's you...you can instead put the RileyLink far away from your iPhone or put the RileyLink in the microwave. That will keep the RileyLink from hearing the Loop's deactivate pod command. If RileyLink can't hear it, then your pod won't receive it.</li> <li>Prevent the pod from hearing: Move the beeping pod to a place where the pod is incapable of hearing the command. There are several options depending on what works for you:<ul> <li>Put the beeping pod far away...\"shouldn't be able to hear those beeps anymore\" kind of distance.</li> <li>Put the pod in a not-turned-on-but-door-is-closed microwave.</li> <li>Put the pod in a Faraday bag, if you own one.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Ok.

Eventually, you'll be given a \"<code>Continue</code>\" button that you'll want to use.</p> <p></p> <p>Press the \"<code>Continue</code>\" button. The instructions start with \"<code>fill a new pod with insulin</code>\"...BUT DO NOT!  Instead, bring that beeping pod back to the hearing range. Turn that RileyLink back on if you turned it off. Once you get the RileyLink on and the pod back in range, you'll just press the Pair button and hopefully you'll find success with the process. If this pairing attempt is still unsuccessful, remember to still exhaust repositioning and Step 4 options before giving up on that pod.

The information in this video is still generally useful with the last-half focused on automatic-bolus - the automatic-bolus dosing strategy has now been incorporated into Loop main branch. Loop has moved on to using only one stable branch (main), with dev recommended for developer/testers.</p>"},{"location":"version/development/#loop-github-information","title":"Loop GitHub Information","text":"<p>Loop developers own an account in GitHub called LoopKit.  Within that account, the developers have several \"repositories\" that support Loop in particular. A repository is like a book...let's think of it like a cookbook for now. Within the LoopKit account, there are repositories for Loop itself, LoopDocs, and various other supporting \"frameworks\" that are helper repositories for Loop to build correctly. For example, Loop's repo has a lot of the info about the app itself; the outward facing things that you interact with. How information is put to you and taken in from you...that's in Loop repository code. But, there's more than just a user interface for Loop. Loop has to do a lot of complex work like Bluetooth communications, algorithm math, pump communications, etc. The Loop app has help from frameworks to do those other parts. CGMBLEkit for some of the transmitter parts of Loop, RileyLink_ios for the pump managers (talking to the pumps and decoding their information), LoopKit for the algorithm about carbs and insulin curves, etc.</p> <p>When you build Loop, in the background, Loop pulls those other frameworks (7 in total) into the build process using \"Carthage\".  Carthage is like a personal shopper. You give it a shopping list (the cartfile in Loop code is that shopping list) and it goes and fetches that for you during the build process. Sometimes your computer has an old shopping list...and that can cause build errors. Hence the \"carthage update\" fix in the Build Errors page...that command updates the shopping list to get the right versions of those frameworks.</p> <p></p> <p>Anyways...so now you know about the general structure of Loop and LoopKit in GitHub. Now we can discuss Loop itself a little deeper.</p> <p>So let's imagine Loop as a cookbook. The developers are the authors/chefs of the recipes (code) in the cookbook. The authors spend countless hours testing new recipes, taste testing, documenting improvements. They send the drafts to the editor, who makes suggestions and eventually the cookbook is finalized. There are no grammar issues, no typos, the photos are beautiful and the recipes are yummy. They publish the book and you see a gorgeous final product on the shelves. That is called a \"release\" and it is the main branch. This book has been well-tested and is super stable. Every time you cook with those recipes, you know exactly what you're getting and lots of people have had a chance before you to make sure that it all tastes good. Main branch is stable and tested.</p> <p>But then...the chefs/developers go on a trip. They are inspired by new cuisine and want to add new recipes to the old cookbook. (Things like omnipod support and overrides are new \"recipes\" that were developed since the last main release, for example.) But, the process for developing a recipe is arduous. Lots of trial and error involved. Lots of tweaking ingredients (code). The editors try out the new recipes and offer feedback (similar to the Issues List in GitHub). While the recipes are being developed, they have a version of the old cookbook that gets marked up...edited in pencil a lot. Scribbles and notes in the side. Revisions happen frequently, because that's what testing new recipes is all about. These marked-up versions of the cookbook are called \"dev\" branch. Short for \"development\" branch. Like the name sounds...this is where new developments are happening, new recipes and tweaks.</p> <p>After much testing and tweaking, eventually the recipes get the flavors right (bugs in code are squashed) and enough people have provided feedback and careful observations of results...that the book goes to the publishing house for the next printing. The cookbook is republished with an updated edition number and new recipes are highlighted. When this happens in Loop, Loop's main branch is updated with the new features coming from dev (aka, \"dev branch is merged into main branch\"). When that happens, main branch gets another \"release\" version. For that moment, dev and main are exactly the same. They stay the same until the Loop developers start working on the next batch of improvements, could be the next hour even or days later, but the process begins again.

Within that account, the developers have several \"repositories\" that support Loop in particular. A repository is like a book...let's think of it like a cookbook for now. Within the LoopKit account, there are repositories for Loop itself, LoopDocs, and various other supporting \"frameworks\" that are helper repositories for Loop to build correctly. For example, Loop's repo has a lot of info about the app itself; the outward-facing things that you interact with. How information is put to you and taken in from you...that's in Loop repository code. But, there's more than just a user interface for Loop. Loop has to do a lot of complex work like Bluetooth communications, algorithm math, pump communications, etc. The Loop app has help from frameworks to do those other parts. CGMBLEkit for some of the transmitter parts of Loop, RileyLink_ios for the pump managers (talking to the pumps and decoding their information), LoopKit for the algorithm about carbs and insulin curves, etc.</p> <p>When you build Loop from LoopWorkspace, each of those repositories is downloaded to your computer.  This is slower than the old zip-download as far as downloading Loop - but it is much faster when you build Loop because all the files are already on your computer.</p> <p>LoopWorkspace uses submodules to define how the frameworks are coordinated for building. The graphic below shows the dev branch at a particular point in time.

If you were to fork Loop on GitHub, then the branches that you can see on GitHub are \"remote\" branches - they're hosted on the GitHub server. On the other hand, you can also create \"local\" branches that are stored directly on your computer by \"checking out\" the remote branch. You'll need to \"commit\" your changes to the local branch, then \"push\" those changes to the remote branch in order to be able to see them in GitHub. There are specific commands that you can type into the command line to do all of these actions, but I'm not going to go into detail because there are different ways and everyone has their own preference.</p> <p>It's a little easier to think about this with an analogy. Let's say you're working at a company that's creating a cookbook. There's a centralized, production-ready version of the cookbook on their website that all the employees can view. Think of the website version of this cookbook as being like the remote branch. You're assigned to change the pancake recipe in the cookbook. Since the company doesn't want employees to make changes directly to the version of the cookbook that the customers see, you need to make a copy of it on your computer so you can make your changes to the pancake recipe. When you make the personal copy on your computer, it's like \"checking out\" the remote branch. Your copy is like the local branch - you can make whatever changes you want without having to worry about customers accidentally seeing them. When you make an important change to the recipe (like adding a photo or changing the ingredients), you might want to make a note in the edit history so that you can go back to that version of the recipe in case you accidentally make unintended changes - those notes you make would be \"commits\". Once you're happy with the recipe, you'll add it back into the production version of the cookbook on the website, which is similar to what you're doing when you \"push\" your changes.</p> <p>Where do the submodules fit in? Each submodule is actually a branch, so when you make changes to multiple submodules, you'll need to commit those changes to their respective branches. Let's say you've made changes to Loop and LoopKit. You'll need to go into Loop and commit and push the changes, then go into LoopKit and commit and push the changes.</p> <p>There are a few different ways to keep track of all these different branches. Some people like using the command line (which is what you're using when you do commands like <code>git clone</code>) because it's very customizable and has the largest variety of commands. Others like to use graphical Git editors, which make it easier to see changes and be able to do a variety of common actions (like cloning, committing, and pushing) with the push of a button. Everyone has their own preferences, but some methods that Loop contributors have used in the past include the command line, Gitkraken, and SourceTree.</p>"},{"location":"version/overview-version/","title":"Version Overview","text":""},{"location":"version/overview-version/#version-overview","title":"Version Overview","text":"<p>The Version tab of LoopDocs contains information about Loop versions, code customization and development.</p> <p>Map to this section:</p> <ul> <li>Loop Releases<ul> <li>Description of the current released version of Loop including when it was released</li> <li>Reverse chronology of earlier releases</li> </ul> </li> <li>Code Customization<ul> <li>Instructions for customizing your DIY code</li> <li>Think of this as your personalized version</li> </ul> </li> <li>Customize with Browser<ul> <li>Instructions for customizing using a browser</li> </ul> </li> <li>Simulator Build<ul> <li>Instructions for building to a simulator</li> </ul> </li> <li>Loop Development<ul> <li>Description of the development process for Loop</li> <li>Information you need if you want to participate</li> </ul> </li> <li>Build Dev<ul> <li>Discussion of methods to build the dev branch</li> </ul> </li> <li>LoopWorkspace<ul> <li>If you are interested in development, this page goes into more detail</li> <li>The primary focus is on techniques for using git</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"version/releases/","title":"Loop Releases","text":""},{"location":"version/releases/#loop-releases","title":"Loop Releases","text":"<p>The new features added with each Loop release (starting with Loop version 2.0) are provided for reference.</p>"},{"location":"version/releases/#loop-3-compatibility","title":"Loop 3 Compatibility","text":"<p>Be aware that Loop 3 is forward compatible:</p> <ul> <li>You can build Loop 3 over older versions of Loop and maintain therapy settings as well as your configuration for CGM and pump (including a pod)</li> <li>You can build Loop 3 using a browser on any computer (no Mac required) with GitHub Browser Build</li> <li>Your phone must be running at least iOS 15.1 (although some people report they needed newer iOS than that when building with GitHub Browser Build)</li> </ul> <p>Loop 3 is NOT backwards compatible.\u00a0Once you build Loop 3 or later on your phone, you cannot return to Loop 2.2.x or FreeAPS without some additional work.</p> <ul> <li>Be prepared to enter all your settings again and start a new pod</li> <li>If you use Loop Follow, you do not need to delete Loop Follow</li> <li>When downgrading to an older version of Loop from Loop 3, you have to delete all apps with a shared app group ID<ul> <li>For more information, click on Remove Apps with Shared App Group</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"version/releases/#current-release","title":"Current Release","text":"<p>The current released version for Loop main is v3.2.3.

What this means is that food absorption was modeled as a flat, even effect (like the straight grey graph that you'll see in the Insulin Counteraction Effects chart after you added a carb entry. But looking at large groups of meals' datasets (and supported by personal, anecdotal experiences), food really has a bit more of a non-linear absorption. Meaning, we usually see more of a food impact up-front than the old carb model in Loop predicted.</p> <p>What did that mismatch mean for us if the model predicts a linear absorption, but the meal actually behaves differently?</p> <ol> <li>Bolusing: You've probably seen smaller upfront boluses for meals than you would have preferred. This is because the insulin was predicted to over-power the linear (slower) carb model soon after a bolus is given.</li> <li>Early low temp basals: You've also probably seen a tendency to have early zero basal or low basals set by Loop for the first 30-60 minutes after a meal bolus if you don't have a significant blood glucose spike immediately after the carb entry. This might have been even more obvious for those of you who are regularly waiting to eat after a bolus, too.</li> </ol> <p>With a non-linear absorption model, the carb absorption will more closely match observed blood glucose impacts we've seen after meals. And when the model is more closely matching actual experience, that means the predicted blood glucose curves will do a better job at providing more upfront bolus and not having the tendency to have overly conservative temp basals soon after a meal.</p>"},{"location":"version/releases/#overrides-introduced","title":"Overrides Introduced","text":"<p>Loop v2.0 marks the first time Loop master branch has overrides included.
