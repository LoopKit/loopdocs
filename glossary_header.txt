# Glossary

Each item in the glossary is also a Tooltip. The word or phrase is repeated in parentheses to assist those using Google Translate.

When Google Translate is selected:

* Tooltips, indicated by dashed underline, continue to be shown in English
* On the Glossary page
    * The first instance (in bold) remains in English
    * The second instance (in parentheses) is translated to your selected language
