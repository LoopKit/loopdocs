# Loop Docs

This is the repo that contains the source files for the [Loop Docs](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs) site.

## Contributing

To suggest changes, fork this repository, edit the files, and submit your changes as a pull request.

### Previewing Changes

To preview your work as you edit you must set up two python packages that are used to create this site using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). They are `mkdocs`, and `mkdocs-bootswatch`.

Review [Properly Installing Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) for help getting Python installed. MkDocs works with Python 2.7, 3.3-3.6, and pypy.

* Install python modules

```bash
$ cd <loopdocs project location>
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Or, install modules individually

```bash
$ pip install mkdocs=1.1.2
$ pip install mkdocs-bootswatch==1.1.0
```

* Run mkdocs server locally

```bash
$ cd <loopdocs project location>
$ mkdocs serve
```

* Preview docs in browser. Most changes will update automatically as you edit. Configuration and navigation changes will require restarting the mkdocs server.
* Optionally, you can share the preview with others by uploading them to your repository's `gh-pages` branch

```bash
$ mkdocs gh-deploy
```

## Conventions

### Links

Links should be written like this:

```markdown
In the same directory: [Click here for step 14](step14.md)

In a directory below the current page: [Click here for step 14](build/step14.md)

In a directory "outside" the current directory: [Click here for step 14](../build/step14.md)

Like above, but linking directly to a heading/anchor in step14.md:

[Click here for step 14](../build/step14.md#sign-four-targets)

```

Notice about mkdocs: "Using absolute paths with links is not officially supported. Relative paths are adjusted by MkDocs to ensure they are always relative to the page. Absolute paths are not modified at all. This means that your links using absolute paths might work fine in your local environment but they might break once you deploy them to your production server."

```markdown
Do NOT do this : [Click here for step 14](/build/step14.md)

The link starts with a '/'. Do not do this.
```

### Images

The conventions for linking to images is the same as linking to pages as described above.

New images should be placed in the "img" directory just below the md-file.

Example of correct link to image.

```markdown
![iPhone](img/phones.png)

```

With images it is possible to add extra attributes like 'width' and 'center'.

```markdown

![iPhone](img/phones.png){width="300"}

This will get rendered to this: <img alt="iPhone" src="img/phones.png" width="300">

You can also center a image, by adding '{align="center"}' on a new line
just below the paragraph you want center:

![Eros](img/eros.png){width="750"}
{align="center"}

This will get rendered to this:
<p align="center">
    <img alt="Eros" src="../img/eros.png" width="750" />
</p>

```

### Admonitions

[Admonitions](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/admonition/) are a markdown extension that enable formatted blocks for visually calling out information.

The markdown syntax used by loopdocs is:

```markdown
!!!keyword
    If no title is given, keyword (first letter capitalized) is used as the title line.
    This syntax works but is discouraged for loopdocs - please explicitly add the title string if one is desired.

!!!keyword ""
    If a blank title is provided, no title is applied.
    Every indented line is included in the "box" created by this admonition

!!!keyword "Title String"
    If an explicit title string is provided, that is used as the title.
    The displayed title string matches the capitalization provided.

    Every indented line is included in the "box" created by this admonition
```

The keyword Cascading Style Sheet (css) definitions are found in docs/stylesheets/admonitions.css.

Please use the keywords in the first column, but be aware that older *.md files may use the synonym.

```markdown
| keyword  | synonym  |  example in build                   | color  |
| green    |  danger  |  step3.md, Time Estimate            | green  |
| info     |          |  step3.md, Summary                  | blue   |
| faqs     |          |  step3.md, FAQs                     | orange |
| note     |          |  step3.md, MMT pump model/firmware  | grey   |
| warning  |          |  step3.md, Reminder and Disclaimer  | orange |
```
Note that faqs and warning use the same style. However, the meaning is quite different, so moving forward please use the keyword ```faqs``` for FAQs.

The 3 top boxes on many pages, but especially the Build Step series should aways use
```
!!!green "Time Estimate"

!!!info "Summary"

!!!faqs "FAQs"
```
